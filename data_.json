It has been owned by Cox Media Group since its inception, making it one of two stations that have been built and signed on by Cox (alongside company flagship WSB-TV in Atlanta). WHIO-TV's transmitter is located off Germantown Street in the Highview Hills neighborhood of southwest Dayton. It shares facilities with sister properties the Dayton Daily News and Cox's Miami Valley radio stations in the Cox Media Center building on South Main Street near downtown Dayton.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nWHIO-TV signed on February 23, 1949, on channel 13. It was the first television station in Dayton to begin broadcasting, although WLWD (then channel 5, now WDTN, channel 2) was the first to have its license granted.\nThe station has been owned by the Cox publishing family and their related companies since its inception; Cox also publishes the Dayton Daily News, the first newspaper ever purchased[4] by Cox Enterprises founder James M. Cox. In fact, WHIO-TV is only the second of three television stations built by Cox from the ground up, merely five months after its sister property WSB-TV in Atlanta, where Cox Media Group is headquartered now. WHIO-TV's licensee, Miami Valley Broadcasting, was originally used as the official name for Cox Media's television arm for decades.\nWHIO-TV has been a CBS affiliate from the very beginning, and is the only station in Dayton never to have changed its primary affiliation; it did air some programming from the long-defunct DuMont Television Network during its first three years on the air.\nThe station moved to channel 7 in 1952 following the release of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s Sixth Report and Order, which reorganized VHF channel assignments throughout much of Ohio and the Midwest.[5]\nWHIO-TV also served as the default CBS affiliate for most of the Lima, Ohio market. (The station reaches most of the Lima DMA with a Grade B signal). This was especially the case before a low-powered CBS affiliate, WLMO-LP, went on the air in Lima. WHIO-TV also remains on Spectrum's Lima cable systems, along with Columbus CBS affiliate WBNS-TV.\nIn 1979, Cox Broadcasting almost filed to sell WHIO to locally based Ohio Valley Broadcasting Company, a subsidiary of M&M Broadcasting and Dyson-Kissner Associates during a proposed General Electric merger with Cox Broadcasting, with its new group being led by Stanley G. Mouse, executive vice president of Cox Broadcasting, and Jack P. McCarthy, then-vice president and general manager of the station, for $47.5 million, but the deal apparently fell through due to a lack of Federal Communications Commission approval.[6]\nOn December 15, 2009, Cox Media Group announced that it would move WHIO-TV and its Dayton radio cluster\u2013WHIO AM-FM, WHKO and WZLR\u2013from its home since the 1950s on Wilmington Avenue in Dayton (at the Kettering city line),[7] to the Cox Media Center building (also the current home of the Daily News) on South Main Street in Dayton, by December 2010. WHIO-TV began broadcasting from the new facility at 2:35\u00a0a.m. on December 12, 2010.[8]\nWHIO-TV's newscasts, known as NewsCenter 7 since the mid-1970s, have been in first place in the Nielsen ratings for many years, and that trend continues to this day.[9]\nWHIO-TV's digital subchannel 7.2 became an affiliate of MeTV on December 1, 2014.[10] The subchannel is branded as \"MeTV WHIO Classic Television\". A longtime, formerly-used lower-case WHIO logo was included along with the MeTV logo. The subchannel's on-air advertisements include old WHIO radio jingles running over clips of former WHIO-TV anchors and current MeTV shows. The subchannel also runs jingles from the \"Hit Radio\" and \"Warp Factor\" packages created by JAM Creative Productions in Dallas.[11]\nDigital subchannel 7.3 was added as a Laff affiliate on April 15, 2015, the network's launch date.[12][13]\nIn February 2019, it was announced that Apollo Global Management would acquire Cox Media Group and Northwest Broadcasting's stations.[14][15] Although the group had planned to operate under the name Terrier Media, it was announced in June 2019 that Apollo would also acquire Cox's radio and advertising businesses, and retain the Cox Media Group name.[16] The sale was completed on December 17, 2019.[17]\n\n2019 transmitter outage[edit]\nOn November 5, 2019, WHIO-TV's over-the-air (OTA) signal became unavailable to much of the market after, according to the station, defects in its new transmitter resulted in electric arcs, burning the old transmission line. According to the station, the need to inspect, repair, and/or replace over 1,000 feet (300\u00a0m) of transmission line, coupled with inclement weather and a shortage of tower repair crews due to the then-recent spectrum reallocation repack, delayed the repair process.[18] The outage affected OTA reception of all subchannels, including 7.1 (CBS) for all satellite television viewers who subscribed to local channel packages, as the satellite providers rebroadcast WHIO-TV's OTA signal of subchannel 7.1. A few days into the outage, with the consent of WHIO-TV, DirecTV replaced the station at first with WCBS-TV from New York City, then with WKRC-TV from Cincinnati; Dish Network replaced the station with WOIO from Cleveland.[19] Customers using cable or streaming television services were still able to view WHIO-TV programming.[20] On November 15, per an agreement with Greater Dayton Public Television, owner of PBS member WPTD (channel 16), WHIO-TV requested special temporary authority from the FCC to transmit its main (CBS) subchannel over subchannel 16.2, displacing WPTD's \"16 Again\" service.[21][18][22] On November 18, WPTD subchannel 16.2 began broadcasting WHIO-TV programming OTA, and this feed was also picked up by DirecTV and Dish Network.[23] The resolution on 16.2 was in 480i standard definition, compared to channel 7.1's 1080i high definition and the signal also lacked closed captioning; on the first day of broadcast, most of the audio feed was missing, but this was subsequently corrected; subchannels 7.2 (MeTV) and 7.3 (Laff) remained unavailable to OTA viewers. On November 21, 2019, WHIO-TV announced its signal was once again available for OTA viewers; DirecTV and Dish Network restored WHIO-TV's signal from subchannel 7.1 and WPTD returned to normal content on subchannel 16.2. Once WHIO-TV's digital broadcast was restored, many OTA viewers had to rescan their tuners to pick up the station's signal since they would have already rescanned for WDTN's November 8 move.[24]\n\nTri-State Network[edit]\nAdvertisement for the premiere of The Wendy Barrie Show, originating from WHIO-TV in Dayton and simulcast on WKRC-TV in Cincinnati and WTVN (now WSYX) in Columbus.\nIn 1953, Cox and Taft Broadcasting formed the short-lived \"Tri-State Network\" to compete with entertainment programming produced by Crosley Broadcasting Corporation and airing on Crosley television stations in the Dayton, Cincinnati and Columbus markets. On January 11, 1954, a new version of The Wendy Barrie Show (which had aired several years earlier on several national networks) premiered from WHIO-TV's studios; it was simulcast on Taft's WKRC-TV in Cincinnati and WTVN (now WSYX) in Columbus.[25] Wendy Barrie's contract was terminated in October 1954.[26]\n\nLogo[edit]\nThroughout the 1960s and into the early 1970s, WHIO-TV's logo was the numeral \"7\" with the station's call letters and city of license inside a perforated circle. By the early 1970s the logo was streamlined, with the \"7\" now broken at the point where the two lines in the \"7\" meet; by this time the \"7\" was by itself inside a solid unbroken circle (usually with the call letters nearby), drawing comparisons with the \"Circle 7 logo\" used by New York's WABC-TV and other ABC-owned stations. A graphics package used around 1996 also was used, with modifications, at three other Cox-owned stations: WSOC-TV in Charlotte, WFTV in Orlando, and KIRO-TV in Seattle. Aside from some slight changes, this logo remained until early 2007, when the break was removed.[27][28][29] Even after the change, the \"broken 7\" logo remained on the anchor desk until the move to the Cox Media Center building in December 2010.\nThe station debuted its new \"button 7\" logo on March 30, 2013, which sports a simple white \"7\" on a blue circular background.\nThe television station's call letters, as well as those of its sister radio stations, were depicted in a particular lower-case font from the 1970s until 1992.[30] That logo was resurrected to become part of the branding for the MeTV digital subchannel.\n\nProgramming[edit]\nSports programming[edit]\nThe Dayton Dragons began televising games on digital channel 7.2 (Time Warner Cable channels 23 and 372) on April 9, 2009,[31] eventually airing 25 games per season. In the 2016 season, the Dragons telecasts moved to WBDT.\nWHIO also airs all Cincinnati Bengals games carried by CBS. As Dayton is 50 miles from Cincinnati, it is considered a secondary market to the Bengals, meaning all road games must be televised in their entirety. Given that the Bengals are the most popular team in the Dayton market, WHIO airs both home and road games.\nThe Cleveland Browns also have a sizable fan base in southwest Ohio, and WHIO airs their preseason games when possible as well as any regular season games that do not conflict with the Bengals.\n\nWeather[edit]\nStorm Center 7[edit]\nWHIO-TV currently calls its team of meteorologists the \"Storm Center 7 weather team\". WHIO-TV bills its radar (which is powered by Baron Services) as \"Live Doppler 7\".\nWHIO-TV did not use its own professional meteorologists until 1993, with the hiring of Penn State meteorology graduate Heidi Sonen.[32][33] The station dropped the AccuWeather service it had previously featured and hired other meteorologists to fill out the staff, including former Weather Channel meteorologist Fred Barnhill. USAF meteorologist Warren Madden was hired from nearby Wright-Patterson Air Force Base; he went to The Weather Channel in December, 1996.\nAfter Sonen's retirement in 1997, the station hired more Penn State graduates for the role of Chief Meteorologist, including Brian Orzel and Jamie Simpson.\nIn December 2004, the station introduced StormCenter 7, which is a weather center created by FX Group that doubles as a set where weather reports can be done.\nOn May 7, 2015, the station announced that it had hired Eric Elwell as its new chief meteorologist, with Brett Collar hired as the new weekend morning meteorologist. Both were announced to be starting in June, with all existing meteorologists at the station remaining, but in some cases being rotated on the schedule.[34] Collar officially began on June 20, 2015, with Elwell's first day on June 29, 2015.[35]\nOn November 19, 2018, WHIO-TV announced that it had hired McCall Vrydaghs as its chief meteorologist, effective immediately. Elwell would continue to work for the station as the meteorologist for the noon broadcast prior to leaving the station at the end of the year to move closer to his family in Columbus. Vrydaghs had been part of the team of meteorologists with the station since 2012. With Vrydaghs' promotion, Dontae Jones, who had previously been working as a morning meteorologist in North Carolina, also joined the team.[36]\n\nLive Doppler 7[edit]\nOn June 29, 2007, WHIO-TV debuted its new doppler weather radar, initially billed as \"New Live Doppler 7\", then \"Live Doppler 7 HD\". The radar was used in every weathercast and, for several years, on the station's website, but, though retaining the \"Live Doppler 7\" name on-air, WHIO discontinued operation of its radar in June 2021.\n\n7 Weather Now[edit]\nOn December 15, 2006, WHIO-TV launched 7 Weather Now, programmed 24 hours a day, with a mix of frequently updated locally produced forecasts and content from the AccuWeather Channel. Live coverage of developing severe weather could be found on 7 Weather Now, as well as the latest watches and warnings. Weekday mornings from 7 to 8 a.m., the final hour of News Center 7 Daybreak was rebroadcast on the channel.[37][38] Effective December 1, 2014, 7 Weather Now is no longer programmed on digital channel 7.2 but can be found as a live stream at the station's website and through the WHIO Weather mobile app.[10]\n\nWidescreen and high definition news[edit]\nWHIO-TV began broadcasting its newscasts in a 16:9 widescreen standard definition format on April 1, 2007; it was the first Ohio station outside of Cleveland to switch to this new format.\nIn the station's December 12, 2010 move to the Cox Media Center, all of its cameras, graphics and equipment were replaced with full high definition equipment. Beginning with that day's late-night newscast (which was delayed to 11:26\u00a0p.m. due to an overrun of CBS network programming), WHIO-TV began broadcasting all locally-shot portions of its newscasts \u2014 studio segments and live field reports \u2014 in high definition.\nWHIO-TV remained the only station in the Dayton area to broadcast local newscasts in high definition or 16:9 widescreen until July 21, 2012, when WDTN made the upgrade to HD. WKEF followed suit during a move to a new facility. Local commercials on WHIO-TV, however, continue to be stretched from their original 4:3 standard definition to widescreen dimensions.\nOn January 21, 2016, WHIO-TV debuted a new set, designed by FX Group.[39][40]\n\nNotable alumni[edit]\nJim Baldridge, co-anchor 1972\u20131988, lead anchor 1988\u20132009, now retired\nPhil Donahue, co-anchor during the 1960s, left for WLWD in 1967\nMick Hubert, sports anchor/director 1979\u20131989, retired radio play-by-play announcer for University of Florida\nTracie Savage, anchor/reporter 1986\u20131991\nBob Shreve, overnight host of Night People Theater, a Friday night/Saturday morning movie program, similar to his Saturday night program in Cincinnati (died in 1990)\nGil Whitney, weather specialist, reporter, anchor and emcee; died in 1982\nTrivia[edit]\nThe highest quality surviving broadcast copy of The Star Wars Holiday Special is derived from this TV station.[41]\n\nTechnical information[edit]\nSubchannels[edit]\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\n\nSubchannels of WHIO-TV[42]\n\n\nChannel\n\nRes.\n\nAspect\n\nShort name\n\nProgramming\n\n\n7.1\n\n1080i\n16:9\nWHIO-HD\nMain WHIO-TV programming / CBS\n\n\n7.2\n\n480i\nMe TV\nMeTV\n\n\n7.3\n\n4:3\nLAFF\nLaff\n\n\n45.3\n\n480i\n4:3\nAntenna\nAntenna TV (WRGT-DT3)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Broadcast on behalf of another station\nAnalog-to-digital conversion[edit]\nWHIO-DT began transmitting its digital signal on channel 41 in October 2001.[43] The station shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 41.[44][45][46] Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 7.\nWHIO-TV moved its digital signal from channel 41 to channel 33 at 10 a.m. on October 18, 2019, as part of the FCC's spectrum reallocation process.[47][48]\n\nSee also[edit]\nChannel 7 virtual TV stations in the United States\nChannel 33 digital TV stations in the United States\nList of television stations in Ohio\nList of television stations in Ohio (by channel number)\nList of television stations in the United States by call sign (initial letter W)\nMiami Valley Channel (cable channel operated by WHIO-TV from September 1994 through the end of 2006; served as UPN affiliate from October 1998 to September 2006)\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d \"Licensing and Management System\". enterpriseefiling.fcc.gov.

Owned by the E. W. Scripps Company, the station maintains studios on South New Road in Waco, and its transmitter is located near Moody, Texas. KXXV and co-owned KRHD-CD (channel 15) in Bryan split the market; KRHD-CD is a semi-satellite of KXXV with separate local news programming for the Brazos Valley.\nWaco was the largest market in the United States without three network-affiliated TV stations until KXXV began broadcasting on March 22, 1985, under the local ownership of Central Texas Broadcasting Company. Briefly the NBC affiliate in the market, KXXV switched to ABC in December 1985 when NBC returned to rival KCEN-TV. It has successively been owned by Shamrock Broadcasting, Drewry Communications, Raycom Media, and Scripps. It has typically been a third-place station in local news coverage to its more established competitors.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nWithin weeks of each other in 1977, Central Texas Broadcasting Company, formed by Waco businessman Robert A. Mann, and Business Communications Inc. of Fort Worth applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for Waco's channel 25.[2][3] Mann had been approached to be part of the Fort Worth-based group but found he would not own as much of the proposed station as he wished, so he mounted his own application.[4] A third company, Heart O' Texas Broadcasting Company, applied in September,[5] and on December 27, they were joined by Blake-Potash Corporation.[6] The four applications were placed into comparative hearing status by the FCC on December 4, 1979,[7] and hearings concluded a year later.[8]\nIn November 1981, FCC administrative law judge Edward Kuhlmann issued an initial decision favoring Blake-Potash. However, the other three applicants lodged appeals with the commission's review board. Kuhlmann found all four applicants to be flawed in some form due to improprieties in their business dealings.[9] However, the review board's decision in July to overturn the initial finding and award Central Texas Broadcasting the permit was based on what it felt was an inaccurate assessment of claims regarding integration of ownership and management\u2014the participation of shareholders in the operation of the proposed station. Kuhlmann had rejected the claims from Mann's group as unreasonable, but the review board found this decision unfounded.[10] Blake-Potash appealed this decision to the full FCC, calling Mann an \"artful dodger\" and alleging he made conflicting claims about his companies to the FCC and the Securities and Exchange Commission; Mann denied the claims.[11][12]\nWith the last appeals by Blake-Potash and Heart O' Texas still pending, Central Texas Broadcasting pressed forward. In July 1984, the firm announced that its proposed station would be known as KWVT; it would locate its studios at New Road and Bagby and its transmitter at Moody; and that it would become an affiliate of NBC when it signed on. At the time, the market only had two local network affiliates, the largest in the United States; KCEN-TV (channel 6) had recently switched to full-time ABC, and KWTX-TV (channel 10) was the CBS affiliate.[13] By the time ground was formally broken on the studios in October, Mann had selected a different call sign: KXXV-TV, from the Roman numeral for 25.[14] NBC programs were unavailable in the Waco area for months while construction took place on the new station, delayed by weather.[15] Bad weather delayed the launch of the new station,[15] but KXXV debuted on March 22, 1985.[16]\nSix months after channel 25 signed on the air, NBC announced it would return to KCEN-TV, which had been its longtime affiliate in the market.[17] At the time, NBC was ascendant in the national rankings, and it sought to improve its standing in much the same way ABC had in the late 1970s and early 1980s; KCEN-TV was among the first stations to switch to the network.[18][19] Though channel 25's affiliation agreement with NBC ran through August 1986,[17] KXXV came to an affiliation agreement with ABC and agreed with KCEN-TV to move the affiliation switch forward by eight months to December 30, 1985.[20]\nIn 1987, Central Texas Broadcasting filed to sell KXXV to Shamrock Broadcasting for $12.5\u00a0million; the FCC granted approval of the transaction over an appeal from shareholders of Heart O' Texas, by now defunct,[21][22][23] but the sale was not completed until the first week of 1988.[24]\nShamrock announced in 1990 that it intended to sell KXXV, KTAB-TV in Abilene, and three radio stations,[25] but KXXV was not sold until 1994, when it was purchased by Drewry Communications of Lawton, Oklahoma; Drewry had previously expressed interest in buying channel 25. While Shamrock was selling in order to focus on larger-market broadcast properties, Drewry owned network affiliates in Texas and Oklahoma.[26] Drewry took over on December 1, 1994, but it did not continue employing five of the station's senior executives, including the general manager.[27] In 1998, Drewry acquired K22DP, a low-power station in Bryan, and relaunched it as KRHD-LP, a version of KXXV with local advertising and the ability to insert local programming.[28]\nKXXV/KRHD added a secondary affiliation with The WB on January 11, 2002, following the sale of the market's previous WB affiliate, KAKW (channel 62), to Univision. KXXV/KRHD aired The WB's prime time lineup after ABC's late night programming, as well as two hours of Kids' WB programming on Sunday mornings.[29][30] In July 2002, KXXV/KRHD ceded the secondary WB affiliation to Fox affiliate KWKT (channel 44) and its Brazos Valley satellite KYLE (channel 28), which would air the network's prime time programming in an earlier time slot but did not pick up Kids' WB.[31] At the same time as channel 25 picked up The WB, it also became the local affiliate of Telemundo, taking over the local channel on the Time Warner Cable system and adding local news briefs and advertising.[30]\nIn 2004, a Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk from nearby Fort Hood clipped guy wires supporting the KXXV tower near Moody; the helicopter then crashed, killing all seven aboard. The lights on the tower were not functioning as a result of recent storms; the station had duly warned the Federal Aviation Administration about the light failure.[32]\nDrewry had planned to sell its stations to London Broadcasting in 2008;[33] however, by January 2009, the deal fell through,[34] and London instead bought KCEN-TV. It was another six years before Drewry sold its broadcasting portfolio to Raycom Media for $160 million in 2015.[35] The sale was completed on December 1.[36]\nRaycom announced a $3.6 billion merger[37] into Atlanta-based Gray Television on June 25, 2018.[38][39] Gray opted to retain KWTX-TV and KBTX-TV in Bryan[40] and sold KXXV\u2013KRHD, as well as WTXL-TV in Tallahassee, Florida, to the E. W. Scripps Company for $55 million.[41] The sale was completed on January 2, 2019.[42] One consequence of the sale was that KXXV lost the Telemundo affiliation to KWTX.[43]\n\nNews operation[edit]\nKXXV debuted 5 and 10 p.m. local newscasts at its launch in March 1985, originally titled Eyewitness News.[44] The early report moved to 6 p.m. by 1986, putting it in direct competition with KCEN and KWTX. The station was a third-place finisher, particularly behind second-place KCEN in early evening news;[45] the May 1989 Arbitron survey saw KXXV edge ahead of KCEN for second for the first time in station history,[46] but it slipped back to third in 1990[47] and was still there by the time Shamrock sold channel 25 to Drewry.[26]\nDrewry made major changes in the station's newscasts after taking over. It refused to rehire the news director, and it fired Ric Streed, who had been the lead male anchor for the station since it began broadcasting.[48] A morning newscast debuted in October 1995,[49] followed by weekend morning newscasts the next year.[50] The company also invested $1.5 million in severe weather coverage; it acquired new vehicles, became the second local station with Doppler weather radar, and started a weather channel on the local cable system.[51][52] In spite of these improvements, the station was still in third place in 2003.[53]\nThe station maintains a news bureau in Killeen to serve the western portion of the area, including Fort Hood, and relaunched a Bryan\u2013College Station bureau for KRHD in 2020.[54]\n\nNotable alumni[edit]\nE.

It initially decided not to broadcast ABC in high-definition, instead offering Telemundo and its weather channel as subchannels.[58] The station shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 25, on February 17, 2009, the original target date for full-power TV stations to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009).[59] The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 26, using virtual channel 25.[60]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Facility Technical Data for KXXV\".

It is the flagship television property of locally based E.\u00a0W. Scripps Company, which has owned the station since its inception. WCPO-TV's studios are located in the Mount Adams neighborhood of Cincinnati next to the Elsinore Arch, and its transmitter is located at the site of the station's original studios on Symmes Street, in the Mount Auburn section of the city.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nEarly history[edit]\nWCPO station identification in 1991, while the station was a CBS affiliate.\nThe station first signed on the air at noon ET on July 26, 1949, and the first face seen was Big Jim Stacey.[3] Originally operating on VHF channel 7, it was Cincinnati's third television station. The call letters came from The Cincinnati Post, who also owned WCPO radio (1230 AM, now WDBZ and 105.1 FM, now WUBE, which were sold in 1966). The station was then owned by Scripps-Howard Newspapers.[4]  It was the third television station to be founded by the E.\u00a0W. Scripps Company following WEWS in Cleveland, which opened in December 1947; and WMCT (now WMC-TV) in Memphis, which signed-on in December 1948 (Scripps would divest that station to Ellis Communications in 1993).\nThe station was originally a primary ABC affiliate and a secondary DuMont Television Network affiliate.[4] With DuMont's demise in 1956, WCPO was left with just ABC until it swapped affiliations with WKRC-TV (channel 12) in 1961, becoming a CBS affiliate.[5] This deal came because WKRC-TV's owner, Taft Broadcasting, had developed very good relations with ABC. Following the release of the FCC's Sixth Report and Order in 1952, all of Cincinnati's VHF stations changed channel positions.[6] WCPO was reassigned to channel 9, as the previous channel 7 allocation was shifted north to Dayton and later given to WHIO-TV.\nThe WCPO stations originally operated from a studio on Symmes Street in Mount Auburn, adjacent to the television station's self-supporting broadcast tower. On June 23, 1967, WCPO-TV moved to a new modern facility on Central Avenue in downtown Cincinnati.[7][8]\n\n1980 hostage situation[edit]\nOn the early morning of October 15, 1980, WCPO and most of its news staff became part of a major news story when James Hoskins, armed with a 9mm J&R M68 semi-automatic rifle and five revolvers, seized control of WCPO's newsroom.[9] Hoskins held reporter Elaine Green and her cameraman at gunpoint in the parking lot of WCPO's studios. He then forced his way into the newsroom and took seven more hostages.\nA self-described terrorist, Hoskins stated in a videotaped interview with Green that he had, among other things, murdered his girlfriend before arriving at the studios. After voicing his displeasure with local government, Hoskins ended by saying that he would let his hostages go, but only after they helped him to barricade himself in their newsroom in anticipation of a shootout with police. Green and the others pleaded with Hoskins to get help, but to no avail. WCPO's news staff ran special newscasts from the parking lot throughout that morning. Hoskins eventually let all the hostages go, and the standoff ended later that morning when Hoskins shot himself dead while on the phone with SWAT negotiators. Green was given a Peabody Award for her handling of the crisis.[10] She later married anchor and then-news director Al Schottelkotte. The two remained married until his death in 1996.\n\nReturn to ABC[edit]\nWCPO's logo ca. 2001\u20132013.\nFor three decades, WCPO had been one of CBS' strongest affiliates. The Cincinnati market was initially unaffected by the 1994\u201396 affiliation switches, as the station was in the middle of a long-term affiliation contract with CBS; however, in September 1995, Scripps and ABC announced a 10-year affiliation deal for WCPO.[11] A year earlier, Scripps had agreed to switch three of its other stations (WMAR-TV in Baltimore, KNXV-TV in Phoenix, and WFTS-TV in Tampa) to ABC[12] as a condition of keeping its affiliation on Scripps' two largest stations, WXYZ-TV in Detroit and WEWS-TV in Cleveland. Both of those stations had been heavily wooed by CBS, which was about to lose longtime affiliates WJBK in Detroit and WJW in Cleveland to Fox as part of an affiliation deal with New World Communications.\nScripps had to maintain the CBS affiliation on WCPO until WKRC's affiliation contract with ABC expired the following year; in the meantime, in October 1995, WCPO introduced new \"9 Stands for News\" station branding that shrunk the CBS logo and revamped its news graphics and theme music,[13] improving ratings.[14] On June 3, 1996, WKRC's contract ended and the two stations reversed the 1961 affiliation swap, with WCPO rejoining ABC and WKRC reuniting with CBS. The last CBS program to air on channel 9 was the 50th Annual Tony Awards at 9 p.m. EDT, while the first ABC program to air was Good Morning America. WCPO set up a toll-free hotline to answer calls from confused viewers. The station debuted new on-air graphics designed by a Los Angeles firm.[15]\nOn May 15, 2004, WCPO moved its studio facilities from 500 Central Avenue (now the site of an expanded Duke Energy Convention Center) to a new state-of-the-art building on Gilbert Avenue, in the Mount Adams neighborhood of Cincinnati.\n\nWCPO-TV logo from 2013 to 2020\nScripps' Cincinnati combination of WCPO and The Cincinnati Post ended when the newspaper ceased publication at the end of 2007. (Its Kentucky edition became an online-only publication simultaneously with the closure of the Post.) WCPO is the only major Cincinnati television station that has been under the same ownership since its inception, as well as the only major station in the market to remain owned by a locally based company.\nOn June 26, 2023, WCPO began airing The Debrief, a nightly newscast airing at 7:30\u00a0p.m. originating from and simulcast on Scripps News\u2014Scripps' in-house national news network that airs on subchannel 9.6\u2014as part of a plan by Scripps to integrate Scripps News programming on their main network affiliates as a way to promote Scripps News and increase the network's exposure.[16]\n\nNews operation[edit]\nWCPO-TV presently broadcasts 43 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours each weekday and four hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). In recent years, WCPO and WKRC have been battling each other for first place in local news viewership, while NBC affiliate WLWT (channel 5) has been lagging behind in third or fourth place. Typically, WCPO leads the evening news race, while WKRC-TV leads in mornings and late evenings. Even after the affiliation switch in 1996 involving two of the strongest affiliates of their respective networks at the time, both stations have remained among the strongest affiliates of their current respective networks.\n\nWCPO lacked a dedicated news department until 1959. Al Schottelkotte, a longtime columnist for The Cincinnati Enquirer (which was then owned by Scripps along with the Post), joined the station as its first news director and anchorman\u2014a post he held until 1986.  Within a year, WCPO was the undisputed local news leader in the Cincinnati market, and remained the top-rated station for over 20 years. Partly because of his influence, the CBS Evening News was not cleared by WCPO for most of Walter Cronkite's tenure; Schottelkotte criticized the program for mostly focusing on world events and believed it \"hardly covered anything west of Washington\", adding: Everything you saw [on CBS' newscast] was an epic from Timbuktu. I was not interested in having the people of Cincinnati waste their time with that kind of news.[17]\nConsumer reporter John Matarese's reports have been syndicated to nine other stations, five of which are Scripps-owned, since 2003. However, as of October 12, 2010, Matarese's consumer reports have been aired on eleven other stations, the majority of which are Scripps owned.[18]\nWCPO began broadcasting its local newscasts in high-definition on August 19, 2007, beginning with the 6 p.m. newscast. Improvements around the station included upgraded weather graphics that match WCPO's upgraded graphics, new panel displays on set (to replace rear-projection CRT monitors on set and old plasma displays with obvious burn-in) and Scripps purchasing JVC HDPro equipment for WCPO.[19] In the summer of 2009, WCPO upgraded its field cameras to provide high definition video.\nIn December 2009, WCPO reached an agreement with local Fox affiliate WXIX-TV (channel 19) to pool videographers at press conferences.[20]\nOn October 1, 2012, WCPO-TV debuted the new Scripps-mandated standardized graphics and music package (\"Inergy\" by Stephen Arnold).\nOn February 3, 2020, WCPO debuted a new logo and an updated Scripps-mandated graphics and music package, while at the same time dropping the 9 On Your Side moniker in favor of simply WCPO 9 News.\n\n9 First Warning Weather[edit]\nCincinnati's television stations have used their weather coverage as a selling point, especially since the Montgomery/Blue Ash tornado of 1999. WCPO brands its radars as \"9 First Warning Doppler\", \"VIPIR 9\" and \"TrueView\". The station runs its own radar located in Batavia, which has an average refresh time of ten seconds.\nOn July 1, 2003, WCPO began to operate a second Doppler weather radar out of the Clermont County Airport in Batavia. In combination with the radar located at WCPO's transmission tower site, both radars were named \"Ultimate Doppler Radar\", though the transmitter dome was eventually put out of service. The new radar operates at a height of 100 feet (30\u00a0m) with its base 834 feet (254\u00a0m) above sea level. Attenuation at the site leaves a radius around the radar blank.\nIn July 2007, WCPO launched a radar system with satellite imagery to allow fine street-level detail of weather events to specific locations. The TrueView system allows for local and nationwide radar sweeps. National Weather Service NEXRAD radars in Wilmington, Ohio (which covers Cincinnati, Dayton and Columbus from a central point, as is done in several areas of the country with multiple major cities), Indianapolis and Louisville are used to provide full-market coverage of severe weather events. The VIPIR 9 technology also utilizes the NEXRAD radars and 9 First Warning Doppler to create its 3D images.\n\nI-Team[edit]\nWCPO's investigative unit, the I-Team, was created in 1988,[21] following the station's Peabody Award-winning investigation of Donald Harvey. The I-Team has won dozens of national awards,[22] including the 1992 Sigma Delta Chi Award and 1993 Alfred I. duPont\u2013Columbia University Award for stories about fraudulent business practices.[23] In 1999, WCPO won the Peabody, duPont, and Sigma Delta Chi awards for investigations into the construction of Paul Brown Stadium.[24] The station won another Peabody in 2001 for a one-hour documentary, Visions of Vine Street, that aired in the wake of the 2001 riots.[21]\n\nNews helicopters[edit]\nIn 1967, WCPO introduced the Newsbird, the first news-gathering helicopter in Cincinnati and one of the first in the industry to feature live transmissions.[25][26] On January 17, 1983, the Bell 206B ran out of fuel and crashed outside the station.[27]\nFrom 1996 to September 2000, WCPO leased a Bell 206L-3 LongRanger III helicopter out of Lunken Field.[28] Outfitted with several cameras, Chopper 9 was used for traffic reports, updates on construction of Paul Brown Stadium and Fort Washington Way, and Friday night football specials. The helicopter proved especially useful for covering the aftermath of the 1999 Blue Ash tornado. WCPO allowed the lease to expire in 2000, citing its high cost.[29]\nOn February 7, 2014, WCPO debuted another Chopper 9, this time a Bell 206B-3 JetRanger, for daily traffic and news coverage.[30][31]\nIn 2016, WCPO debuted Sky 9, a quadcopter drone featuring a 4K-resolution camera.[32] WCPO allowed Chopper 9's lease to expire in February 2020 in favor of Sky 9 drone footage.[33]\n\nNotable alumni[edit]\nAndrea Canning \u2013 evening anchor (former ABC News correspondent, now an NBC News reporter)\nGretchen Carlson \u2013 reporter (later an anchor of Fox News Channel's Fox and Friends)\nNick Clooney \u2013 host of The Nick Clooney Show (later an anchor at WKRC-TV)\nPete Delkus \u2013 chief meteorologist (1996\u20132005; now chief meteorologist at WFAA in Dallas)\nPaula Faris \u2013 sports anchor (now correspondent for ABC News; former weekend anchor of Good Morning America; former co-host of The View)\nBrett Haber \u2013 weekend sports anchor (formerly sports director at WUSA in Washington, D.C.;[34] formerly anchor of SportsCenter on ESPN)\nBill Hemmer (now anchor for Fox News Channel)\nBob Holtzman \u2013 news reporter (now correspondent for ESPN)\n\"Uncle Al\" Lewis \u2013 first art director for WCPO, and host of The Uncle Al Show for 35 years (died in 2009)\nLen Mink \u2013 singer/host of The Len Mink Show (now an evangelist/worship leader for meetings held by televangelist Kenneth Copeland)\nAl Schottelkotte \u2013 WCPO's first news anchor and news director (1953\u201394, died in 1996)\nTechnical information[edit]\nSubchannels[edit]\nThe station's signal is multiplexed:\n\n\nSubchannels of WCPO-TV[35]\n\n\nChannel\n\nRes.\n\nAspect\n\nShort name\n\nProgramming\n\n\n9.1\n\n720p\n16:9\nWCPO-HD\nABC\n\n\n9.2\n\n480i\nCOURTTV\nCourt TV\n\n\n9.3\n\nBOUNCE\nBounce TV\n\n\n9.4\n\nMYSTERY\nIon Mystery\n\n\n9.5\n\nLAFF\nLaff\n\n\n9.6\n\nScripps\nScripps News\n\n\n9.7\n\nHSN\nHSN\n\n\n64.5\n\n480i\n16:9\nDABL\nDabl (WSTR-DT5)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Broadcast on behalf of another station\nSubchannel 9.2 previously carried the same 24-hour local weather programming as the Weather Tracker channel on many local cable systems.[36] Subchannel 9.3 previously carried the Live Well Network (2009\u20132015) until national distribution was discontinued.\nSubchannel 9.4 was added on May 8, 2019, and Escape, previously subchannel 9.2, was moved to 9.4 with the addition of the revived Court TV taking its place on subchannel 9.2. WCPO's Court TV also became Charter Spectrum's channel 995 and Cincinnati Bell Fioptics channel 8.[37] On September 30, 2019, Escape re-branded itself to Ion Mystery.\n\nAnalog-to-digital conversion[edit]\nWCPO-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 9, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television.[38] The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 10,[39] using virtual channel 9.\nSince many viewers had reception issues after the digital transition, even with an increase of power just weeks after the transition, the station filed a Petition for Rulemaking to abandon VHF channel 10 and move to UHF channel 22.[40][41] On October 7, 2009, the FCC issued a \"Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\" for WCPO-TV, which gives the public 25 days to comment on the proposed channel change.[42] On December 10, 2009, the FCC issued a Report & Order, approving WCPO's move from VHF channel 10 to UHF channel 22.[43] On January 19, 2010, WCPO filed a minor change application for a construction permit for their new allotment. The FCC granted the construction permit on July 9.[44] At 2:05\u00a0a.m. on December 8, 2010, WCPO performed a flash-cut, turning off channel 10 and starting digital operations on channel 22. This flash-cut also included a power boost to 910\u00a0kW.[45]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Cincinnati is given third TV outlet.\"[permanent dead link] Broadcasting - Telecasting, March 1, 1948, pg. 83.\n\n^ \"Facility Technical Data for WCPO-TV\".

As of the 2020 Census, the county had a population of 657,974,[2] making it the fourth most populous county in Michigan, and the largest outside of the Detroit area. Its county seat is Grand Rapids.[3] The county was set off in 1831, and organized in 1836.[1] It is named for New York jurist and legal scholar James Kent,[4] who represented the Michigan Territory in its dispute with Ohio over the Toledo Strip.\nKent County is part of the Grand Rapids\u2013Kentwood Metropolitan Statistical Area and is West Michigan's economic and manufacturing center. It is home of the Frederik Meijer Gardens, a significant cultural landmark of the Midwest. The Gerald R. Ford International Airport is the county's primary location for regional and international airline traffic.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nThe Grand River runs through the county. On its west bank are burial mounds, remnants of the Hopewell Indians who lived there.[5] In the 18th century the Odawa migrated to this area and established multiple villages along the Grand River valley.[6]  By the 19th century there were estimated to be over 1000 Odawa.[6][7]  The fur trade became an important industry in the valley during the early 19th century. After the War of 1812, Rix Robinson and Louis Campau were the earliest traders in the area.[8] In 1826, Campau established a trading post in Grand Rapids. In 1831, he bought land and platted the town. Campau is considered the town's \"father\".[9][10][11] One year later, government surveyor Lucius Lyon purchased land north of Campau's property. Campau surveyed and platted the village following Native American trails[10] and Lyon had platted his property in an English grid format, which meant there were two adjoining villages, with different platting formats.[10] Campau later merged the villages under the name of Grand Rapids.[10]\nIn 1831, it was set off from Kalamazoo County.[12] In 1838, Grand Rapids was incorporated[10] as the county's first village. By the end of the century, stimulated by the construction of several sawmills, the area was a significant center for agriculture, logging, and manufacturing furniture.\n\nGeography[edit]\nRockford Dam in Rockford, Michigan\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of 872 square miles (2,260\u00a0km2), of which 847 square miles (2,190\u00a0km2) is land and 25 square miles (65\u00a0km2) (2.9%) is water.[13] Kent County's highest point is Fisk Knob Park,[14] in Solon Township, at 1048 feet.[15]\n\nRivers[edit]\nGrand River, flows through the county from its eastern border to the west, and after passing through Ottawa County, empties into Lake Michigan at Grand Haven. It has three tributaries in Kent County, listed in order of convergence:\nFlat River, enters the county from the east, and joins the Grand from the north, in Lowell.\nThornapple River, enters the county from the south, and joins the Grand in Ada.\nRogue River, enters the county from the north, and joins the Grand in Belmont.\nTrails[edit]\nThese hiking and biking trails run through the county:\n\nNorth Country Trail, runs north\u2013south the length of the county, passing through Cedar Springs, Grattan and Lowell. Lowell is the trail's half-way point, and the national headquarters of the North Country Trail Association is located here.\nThornapple Trail, begins in Kentwood and runs southeast through Dutton and Caledonia.\nWhite Pine Trail begins in Comstock Park and runs northeast through Belmont, Rockford, Cedar Springs, and Sand Lake.\nKent Trails (which is singular in spite of the 's') runs north\u2013south from John Ball Park in Grand Rapids to 84th Street in Byron Township, with an extension that runs east/west along 76th Street and north\u2013south from 76th Street to Douglas Walker Park on 84th street.\nThe Frederik Meijer Trail, which, as of November, 2008, was incomplete, runs east/west mostly along the M-6 freeway and will connect the Kent Trails and the Thornapple Trail when completed.\nCannon Township Trail runs through Cannon Township in the eastern part of the county from Cannon Township Center on M-44. It runs along M-44 then south near Sunfish Lake Road, turning east through the Cannonsburg Cemetery, and ends at Warren Townsend Park near Cannonsburg.\nAdjacent counties[edit]\n13 Mile Road in the rural Courtland Township\nNewaygo County - north\nMontcalm County - northeast\nMuskegon County - northwest\nIonia County - east\nOttawa County - west\nAllegan County - southwest\nBarry County - southeast\nDemographics[edit]\n\n\nHistorical population\nCensusPop.Note%\u00b1\n18402,587\u2014185012,016364.5%186030,716155.6%187050,40364.1%188073,25345.3%1890109,92250.1%1900129,71418.0%1910159,14522.7%1920183,04115.0%1930240,51131.4%1940246,3382.4%1950288,29217.0%1960363,18726.0%1970411,04413.2%1980444,5068.1%1990500,63112.6%2000574,33514.7%2010602,6224.9%2020657,9749.2%U.S. Decennial Census[16]1790\u20131960[17] 1900\u20131990[18]1990\u20132000[19] 2010\u20132019[2]\n\nAs of the 2010 United States Census,[21] there were 602,622 people living in the county. 76.1% were non-Hispanic White, 10.2% Black or African American, 2.4% Asian, 0.7% Native American, 4.5% of some other race and 2.6% of two or more races. 9.7% were Hispanic or Latino (of any race).\n\nThe Grand River in downtown Grand Rapids\nAs of the census[22] of 2000, there were 574,335 people, 212,890 households, and 144,126 families living in the county.

For most of the 20th century, it was rather conservative for an urban county. The GOP only lost the county in four presidential elections from 1888 to 2004, two of which saw the Democratic Party win over 400 electoral votes nationwide. However, the Democrats have received increased support since the 2000s, with Grand Rapids and nearby suburbs supporting the Democratic Party while more rural areas support the Republican Party.[26][27]  Grand Rapids also normally sends Democrats to the state legislature.\nIn 2008, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama narrowly carried the county, receiving 49.34% of its votes to Republican John McCain's 48.83%.[28] It was the first time the county had supported a Democrat for president since 1964, and only the fourth time since 1884. By comparison, George W. Bush had taken almost 59 percent of the county's vote in 2004.\nIn 2012, the county returned to the Republican camp as Mitt Romney won 53.0% of the vote to Obama's 45.35%.[29]  Four years later, Republican Donald Trump won the county with 47.66% of the vote, to 44.61% for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, while Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party received 4.58%.[30]\nIn 2020, Joe Biden received nearly 52% of the votes in the county, the largest vote share for a Democratic candidate since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Biden is only the third Democrat since 1916 to win a majority of the county's vote. By comparison, Obama only won the county by 1,573 votes in 2008 for 49.7 percent of the vote.\nKent County is one of only thirteen counties in the United States to have voted for Obama in 2008, Romney in 2012, Trump in 2016, and Biden in 2020.[a]\nToday, the county is considered a bellwether politically.[31]  In 2018, Gretchen Whitmer became the first Democratic governor to win the county after James Blanchard's 1986 landslide re-election.[32][33] Also during the same cycle, incumbent Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow narrowly carried the county by 0.3 points, only the second time (following Carl Levin in 2008) since Donald Riegle in 1982 the county supported a Democrat for Senate.[34][35][36]\nDespite the county's bellwether status at the federal and state level, it remains very Republican downballot. The GOP still holds most county-level offices, as well as a majority on the county commission.\nIn the House of Representatives, the bulk of the county has been located in Michigan's 3rd congressional district since the 1993 redistricting cycle. That district had previously been the 5th congressional district from 1873 to 1993.[37] The current Representative for the district is Democrat Hillary Scholten. Until Scholten took office in 2023, the city had been represented by a Republican for all but 35 months since 1913. The only Democrat to represent the city in this time was Richard Vander Veen, first elected in a 1974 special election following the district's long-time Representative Gerald Ford's ascension to Vice President. Vander Veen was ousted by Republican Harold S. Sawyer in 1976, and the GOP held the seat without interruption until Scholten's win in 2022. Further underlining how Republican the county has historically been, the Democrats representing Grand Rapids-based districts in the state legislature were typically the only elected Democrats above the county level until 2023.\nA sliver of northern and eastern Kent County, including Cedar Springs and Lowell, is in the 2nd congressional district, represented by Republican John Moolenaar.\n\nCommunities[edit]\nU.S. Census data map showing local municipal boundaries within Kent County.

McLeanPublication dateOctober 27, 1787 \u2013 May 28, 1788Media\u00a0typeNewspaperbook\nThe Federalist Papers is a collection of 85 articles and essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay under the collective pseudonym \"Publius\" to promote the ratification of the Constitution of the United States. The collection was commonly known as The Federalist until the name The Federalist Papers emerged in the twentieth century.\nThe first seventy-seven of these essays were published serially in the Independent Journal, the New York Packet, and The Daily Advertiser between October 1787 and April 1788.[1] A compilation of these 77 essays and eight others were published in two volumes as The Federalist: A Collection of Essays, Written in Favour of the New Constitution, as Agreed upon by the Federal Convention, September 17, 1787, by publishing firm J. & A. McLean in March and May 1788.[2][3] The last eight papers (Nos. 78\u201385) were republished in the New York newspapers between June 14 and August 16, 1788.\n\nThe authors of The Federalist intended to influence the voters to ratify the Constitution. In Federalist No. 1, they explicitly set that debate in broad political terms:It has been frequently remarked, that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not, of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend, for their political constitutions, on accident and force.[4]\nIn Federalist No. 10, Madison discusses the means of preventing rule by majority faction and advocates a large, commercial republic. This is complemented by Federalist No. 14, in which Madison takes the measure of the United States, declares it appropriate for an extended republic, and concludes with a memorable defense of the constitutional and political creativity of the Federal Convention.[5]\nIn Federalist No. 84, Hamilton makes the case that there is no need to amend the Constitution by adding a Bill of Rights, insisting that the various provisions in the proposed Constitution protecting liberty amount to a \"bill of rights.\"[6] Federalist No. 78, also written by Hamilton, lays the groundwork for the doctrine of judicial review by federal courts of federal legislation or executive acts. Federalist No. 70 presents Hamilton's case for a one-man chief executive. In Federalist No. 39, Madison presents the clearest exposition of what has come to be called \"Federalism\". In Federalist No. 51, Madison distills arguments for checks and balances in an essay often quoted for its justification of government as \"the greatest of all reflections on human nature.\" According to historian Richard B. Morris, the essays that make up The Federalist Papers are an \"incomparable exposition of the Constitution, a classic in political science unsurpassed in both breadth and depth by the product of any later American writer.\"[7]\nOn June 21, 1788, the proposed Constitution was ratified by the minimum of nine states required under Article VII. Towards the end of July 1788, with eleven states having ratified the new Constitution, the process of organizing the new government began.[8]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nOrigins[edit]\nAlexander Hamilton, author of the majority of The Federalist Papers\nThe Federal Convention (Constitutional Convention) sent the proposed Constitution to the Confederation Congress, which in turn submitted it to the states for ratification at the end of September 1787. On September 27, 1787, \"Cato\" first appeared in the New York press criticizing the proposition; \"Brutus\" followed on October 18, 1787.[9] These and other articles and public letters critical of the new Constitution would eventually become known as the \"Anti-Federalist Papers\". In response, Alexander Hamilton decided to launch a measured defense and extensive explanation of the proposed Constitution to the people of the state of New York. He wrote in Federalist No. 1 that the series would \"endeavor to give a satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.\"[10]\nHamilton recruited collaborators for the project. He enlisted John Jay, who after four essays (Federalist Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5), fell ill and contributed only one more essay, Federalist No. 64, to the series. Jay also distilled his case into a pamphlet in the spring of 1788, An Address to the People of the State of New-York;[11] Hamilton cited it approvingly in Federalist No. 85. James Madison, present in New York as a Virginia delegate to the Confederation Congress, was recruited by Hamilton and Jay and became Hamilton's primary collaborator. Gouverneur Morris and William Duer were also considered. However, Morris turned down the invitation, and Hamilton rejected three essays written by Duer.[12] Duer later wrote in support of the three Federalist authors under the name \"Philo-Publius\", meaning either \"Friend of the People\" or \"Friend of Hamilton\" based on Hamilton's pen name Publius.\nHamilton chose the pseudonymous name \"Publius\". While many other pieces representing both sides of the constitutional debate were written under Roman names, historian Albert Furtwangler contends that \"'Publius' was a cut above 'Caesar' or 'Brutus' or even 'Cato'. Publius Valerius helped found the ancient republic of Rome. His more famous name, Publicola, meant 'friend of the people'.\"[13] Hamilton had applied this pseudonym to three letters in 1778, in which he attacked fellow Federalist Samuel Chase and revealed that Chase had taken advantage of knowledge gained in Congress to try to dominate the flour market.[13]\n\nAuthorship[edit]\nSee also: James Madison as Father of the Constitution\nJames Madison, Hamilton's major collaborator, later fourth president of the United States (1809-1817)\nAt the time of publication, the authors of The Federalist Papers attempted to hide their identities due to Hamilton and Madison having attended the convention.[14] Astute observers, however, correctly discerned the identities of Hamilton, Madison, and Jay. Establishing authorial authenticity of the essays that constitute The Federalist Papers has not always been clear. After Hamilton's death in 1804, a list emerged, claiming that he alone had written two-thirds of The Federalist essays. Some believe that several of these essays were written by Madison (Nos. 49\u201358 and 62\u201363). The scholarly detective work of Douglass Adair in 1944 postulated the following assignments of authorship, corroborated in 1964 by a computer analysis of the text:[15]\n\nAlexander Hamilton (51 articles: Nos. 1, 6\u20139, 11\u201313, 15\u201317, 21\u201336, 59\u201361, and 65\u201385)\nJames Madison (29 articles: Nos. 10, 14, 18\u201320,[16] 37\u201358 and 62\u201363)\nJohn Jay (5 articles: Nos. 2\u20135 and 64).\nIn six months, a total of 85 articles were written by the three men. Hamilton, who had been a leading advocate of national constitutional reform throughout the 1780s and was one of the three representatives for New York at the Constitutional Convention, in 1789 became the first secretary of the treasury, a post he held until his resignation in 1795. Madison, who is now acknowledged as the father of the Constitution \u2014 despite his repeated rejection of this honor during his lifetime,[17] became a leading member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia (1789\u20131797), secretary of state (1801\u20131809), and ultimately the fourth president of the United States (1809\u20131817).[18]\nJohn Jay, who had been secretary for foreign affairs under the Articles of Confederation from 1784 through their expiration in 1789, became the first Chief Justice of the United States in 1789, stepping down in 1795 to accept election as governor of New York, a post he held for two terms, retiring in 1801.[citation needed]\n\nPublication[edit]\nAn advertisement for the book edition of The Federalist\nThe Federalist articles appeared in three New York newspapers: The Independent Journal, the New-York Packet, and the Daily Advertiser, beginning on October 27, 1787. Although written and published with haste, The Federalist articles were widely read and greatly influenced the shape of American political institutions.[19] Hamilton, Madison and Jay published the essays at a rapid pace. At times, three to four new essays by Publius appeared in the papers in a single week. Garry Wills observes that this fast pace of production \"overwhelmed\" any possible response: \"Who, given ample time could have answered such a battery of arguments? And no time was given.\"[20] Hamilton also encouraged the reprinting of the essays in newspapers outside New York state, and indeed they were published in several other states where the ratification debate was taking place. However, they were only irregularly published outside New York, and in other parts of the country they were often overshadowed by local writers.[21]\nBecause the essays were initially published in New York, most of them begin with the same salutation: \"To the People of the State of New York\".\nThe high demand for the essays led to their publication in a more permanent form. On January 1, 1788, the New York publishing firm J. & A. McLean announced that they would publish the first 36 essays as a bound volume; that volume was released on March 22, 1788, and was titled The Federalist Volume 1.[1] New essays continued to appear in the newspapers; Federalist No. 77 was the last number to appear first in that form, on April 2. A second bound volume was released on May 28, containing Federalist Nos. 37\u201377 and the previously unpublished Nos. 78\u201385.[1] The last eight papers (Nos. 78\u201385) were republished in the New York newspapers between June 14 and August 16, 1788.[1][19]\nA 1792 French edition ended the collective anonymity of Publius, announcing that the work had been written by \"Mm. Hamilton, Maddisson e Gay, citoyens de l'\u00c9tat de New York\".[22] In 1802, George Hopkins published an American edition that similarly named the authors. Hopkins wished as well that \"the name of the writer should be prefixed to each number,\" but at this point Hamilton insisted that this was not to be, and the division of the essays among the three authors remained a secret.[23]\nThe first publication to divide the papers in such a way was an 1810 edition that used a list left by Hamilton to associate the authors with their numbers; this edition appeared as two volumes of the compiled \"Works of Hamilton\". In 1818, Jacob Gideon published a new edition with a new listing of authors, based on a list provided by Madison. The difference between Hamilton's list and Madison's formed the basis for a dispute over the authorship of a dozen of the essays.[24]\nBoth Hopkins's and Gideon's editions incorporated significant edits to the text of the papers themselves, generally with the approval of the authors. In 1863, Henry Dawson published an edition containing the original text of the papers, arguing that they should be preserved as they were written in that particular historical moment, not as edited by the authors years later.[25]\nModern scholars generally use the text prepared by Jacob E. Cooke for his 1961 edition of The Federalist; this edition used the newspaper texts for essay numbers 1\u201376 and the McLean edition for essay numbers 77\u201385.[26]\n\nDisputed essays[edit]\nJohn Jay, author of five of The Federalist Papers, later became the first chief justice of the United States\nWhile the authorship of 73 of The Federalist essays is fairly certain, the identities of those who wrote the twelve remaining essays are disputed by some scholars. The modern consensus is that Madison wrote essays Nos. 49\u201358, with Nos. 18\u201320 being products of a collaboration between him and Hamilton; No. 64 was by John Jay. The first open designation of which essay belonged to whom was provided by Hamilton who, in the days before his ultimately fatal gun duel with Aaron Burr, provided his lawyer with a list detailing the author of each number. This list credited Hamilton with a full 63 of the essays (three of those being jointly written with Madison), almost three-quarters of the whole, and was used as the basis for an 1810 printing that was the first to make specific attribution for the essays.[27]\nMadison did not immediately dispute Hamilton's list, but provided his own list for the 1818 Gideon edition of The Federalist. Madison claimed 29 essays for himself, and he suggested that the difference between the two lists was \"owing doubtless to the hurry in which [Hamilton's] memorandum was made out.\" A known error in Hamilton's list\u2014Hamilton incorrectly ascribed No. 54 to John Jay, when in fact, Jay wrote No. 64\u2014provided some evidence for Madison's suggestion.[28]\nStatistical analysis has been undertaken on several occasions in attempts to accurately identify the author of each individual essay. After examining word choice and writing style, studies generally agree that the disputed essays were written by James Madison. However, there are notable exceptions maintaining that some of the essays which are now widely attributed to Madison were, in fact, collaborative efforts.[15][29][30]\n\nInfluence on the ratification debates[edit]\nThe Federalist Papers were written to support the ratification of the Constitution, specifically in New York. Whether they succeeded in this mission is questionable. Separate ratification proceedings took place in each state, and the essays were not reliably reprinted outside of New York; furthermore, by the time the series was well underway, a number of important states had already ratified it, for instance Pennsylvania on December 12. New York held out until July 26; certainly The Federalist was more important there than anywhere else, but Furtwangler argues that it \"could hardly rival other major forces in the ratification contests\"\u2014specifically, these forces included the personal influence of well-known Federalists, for instance Hamilton and Jay, and Anti-Federalists, including Governor George Clinton.[31] Further, by the time New York came to a vote, ten states had already ratified the Constitution and it had thus already passed\u2014only nine states had to ratify it for the new government to be established among them; the ratification by Virginia, the tenth state, placed pressure on New York to ratify. In light of that, Furtwangler observes, \"New York's refusal would make that state an odd outsider.\"[32]\nOnly 19 Federalists were elected to New York's ratification convention, compared to the Anti-Federalists' 46 delegates. While New York did indeed ratify the Constitution on July 26, the lack of public support for pro-Constitution Federalists has led historian John Kaminski to suggest that the impact of The Federalist on New York citizens was \"negligible\".[33]\nAs for Virginia, which ratified the Constitution only at its convention on June 25, Hamilton writes in a letter to Madison that the collected edition of The Federalist had been sent to Virginia; Furtwangler presumes that it was to act as a \"debater's handbook for the convention there\", though he claims that this indirect influence would be a \"dubious distinction\".[34] Probably of greater importance to the Virginia debate, in any case, were George Washington's support for the proposed Constitution and the presence of Madison and Edmund Randolph, the governor, at the convention arguing for ratification.\n\nStructure and content[edit]\nIn Federalist No. 1, Hamilton listed six topics to be covered in the subsequent articles:\n\n\"The utility of the UNION to your political prosperity\"\u2014covered in No. 2 through No. 14\n\"The insufficiency of the present Confederation to preserve that Union\"\u2014covered in No. 15 through No. 22\n\"The necessity of a government at least equally energetic with the one proposed to the attainment of this object\"\u2014covered in No. 23 through No. 36\n\"The conformity of the proposed constitution to the true principles of republican government\"\u2014covered in No. 37 through No. 84\n\"Its analogy to your own state constitution\"\u2014covered in No. 85\n\"The additional security which its adoption will afford to the preservation of that species of government, to liberty and to prosperity\"\u2014covered in No. 85.[35]\nFurtwangler notes that as the series grew, this plan was somewhat changed. The fourth topic expanded into detailed coverage of the individual articles of the Constitution and the institutions it mandated, while the two last topics were merely touched on in the last essay.\nThe papers can be broken down by author as well as by topic. At the start of the series, all three authors were contributing; the first 20 papers are broken down as 11 by Hamilton, five by Madison and four by Jay. The rest of the series, however, is dominated by three long segments by a single writer: Nos. 21\u201336 by Hamilton, Nos. 37\u201358 by Madison, written while Hamilton was in Albany, and No. 65 through the end by Hamilton, published after Madison had left for Virginia.[36]\n\nOpposition to the Bill of Rights[edit]\nThe Federalist Papers (specifically Federalist No. 84) are notable for their opposition to what later became the United States Bill of Rights. The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was originally controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or protect the rights of the people, rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained to the states and the people. Alexander Hamilton, the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the only rights that people had.[37] [38]\nHowever, Hamilton's opposition to a Bill of Rights was far from universal. Robert Yates, writing under the pseudonym \"Brutus\", articulated this view point in the so-called Anti-Federalist No. 84, asserting that a government unrestrained by such a bill could easily devolve into tyranny. References in The Federalist and in the ratification debates warn of demagogues of the variety who through divisive appeals would aim at tyranny. The Federalist begins and ends with this issue.[39] In the final paper Hamilton offers \"a lesson of moderation to all sincere lovers of the Union, and ought to put them on their guard against hazarding anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation of the States from each other, and perhaps the military despotism of a successful demagogue\".[40] The matter was further clarified by the Ninth Amendment.\n\nJudicial use[edit]\nFederal judges, when interpreting the Constitution, frequently use The Federalist Papers as a contemporary account of the intentions of the framers and ratifiers.[41] They have been applied on issues ranging from the power of the federal government in foreign affairs (in Hines v. Davidowitz) to the validity of ex post facto laws (in the 1798 decision Calder v. Bull, apparently the first decision to mention The Federalist).[42] By 2000[update], The Federalist had been quoted 291 times in Supreme Court decisions.[43]\nThe amount of deference that should be given to The Federalist Papers in constitutional interpretation has always been somewhat controversial. As early as 1819, Chief Justice John Marshall noted in the famous case McCulloch v. Maryland, that \"the opinions expressed by the authors of that work have been justly supposed to be entitled to great respect in expounding the Constitution. No tribute can be paid to them which exceeds their merit; but in applying their opinions to the cases which may arise in the progress of our government, a right to judge of their correctness must be retained.\"[44] In a letter to Thomas Ritchie in 1821, James Madison stated of the Constitution that \"the legitimate meaning of the Instrument must be derived from the text itself; or if a key is to be sought elsewhere, it must be not in the opinions or intentions of the Body which planned & proposed the Constitution, but in the sense attached to it by the people in their respective State Conventions where it recd. all the authority which it possesses.\"[45][46]\n\nComplete list[edit]\nThe colors used to highlight the rows correspond to the author of the paper.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Alexander

This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system.\"\"(This is concept is related to a canon of legal interpretation expressio unius est exclusio alterius) \n\n^  https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2007/januaryfebruary/feature/building-the-bill-rights \"Hamilton and his supporters not only believed enumeration to be unnecessary, they feared that it could restrict the freedom of the people.

While it is independent, it has usually supported the Labour Party from the left. Previous editors at the magazine have included Aneurin Bevan,[2] the Minister of Health who spearheaded the establishment of the National Health Service, former Labour leader Michael Foot,[3] and writer George Orwell, who served as Literary Editor.[4]\nFrom 2008 it faced serious financial difficulties until it was purchased by Jacobin in late 2018, shifting to a quarterly publication model. Since its relaunch the number of paying subscribers has passed 15,000,[1] with columns from high-profile socialist politicians such as former leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn,[5][6][7][8] former Second Deputy Prime Minister of Spain Pablo Iglesias[9] and former Bolivian President Evo Morales.[10] In January 2020, it was used as the platform on which Rebecca Long-Bailey chose to launch her Labour leadership campaign.[11][12]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nOrigins[edit]\nTribune was founded in early 1937 by two wealthy left-wing Labour Party Members of Parliament (MPs), Sir Stafford Cripps and George Strauss, to back the Unity Campaign, an attempt to secure an anti-fascist and anti-appeasement united front between the Labour Party and socialist parties to the left.[13] The latter included Cripps's (Labour-affiliated) Socialist League, the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).\nThe paper's first editor was William Mellor. Among its journalists were Michael Foot and Barbara Betts (later Barbara Castle), while the board included the Labour MPs Aneurin Bevan and Ellen Wilkinson, Harold Laski of the Left Book Club, and the veteran left-wing journalist and former ILP member H. N. Brailsford.\nMellor was fired in 1938 for refusing to adopt a new CPGB policy \u2013 supported by Cripps \u2013 of backing a popular front, including non-socialist parties, against fascism and appeasement; Foot resigned in solidarity. Mellor was succeeded by H. J. Hartshorn, a secret member of the CPGB. Meanwhile, Victor Gollancz, the Left Book Club's publisher, joined the board of directors. For the next year, the paper was little more than an appendage of the Left Book Club, taking an uncritical line on the Popular Front and the Soviet Union.\n\n1940s[edit]\nWith the Nazi-Soviet pact and the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Tribune initially adopted the CPGB's position of denouncing the British and French declarations of war on Germany as imperialist. After the Soviet invasion of Finland, with Cripps off on a world tour, Strauss and Bevan became increasingly impatient with Hartshorn's unrelenting Stalinism. Strauss fired Hartshorn in February 1940, replacing him as editor with Raymond Postgate. Under Postgate's editorship, the Soviet fellow travellers at Tribune were either dismissed, or in Postgate's words, \"left soon after in dislike of me\".[14] From then on, the paper became the voice of the pro-war democratic left in the Labour Party, taking a position similar to that adopted by Gollancz in the volume Betrayal of the Left he edited attacking the communists for backing the Nazi-Soviet pact.[citation needed]\n\nEarly 1941 Tribune flier\nBevan ousted Postgate after a series of personality clashes in 1941, assuming the role of editor himself, although the day-to-day running of the paper was done by Jon Kimche. The Tribune campaigned vigorously for the opening of a second front against Adolf Hitler's Germany, was consistently critical of the Winston Churchill government's failings, and argued that only a democratic socialist post-war settlement in Britain and Europe as a whole was viable.[citation needed]\nGeorge Orwell was hired in 1943 as literary editor. In this role, as well as commissioning and writing reviews, he wrote a series of columns, most of them under the title \"As I Please\", that have become touchstones of the opinion journalist's craft. Orwell left the Tribune staff in early 1945 to become a war correspondent for The Observer, to be replaced as literary editor by his friend Tosco Fyvel, but he remained a regular contributor until March 1947.\nOrwell's most famous contributions to Tribune as a columnist include \"You and the atom bomb\", \"The sporting spirit\", \"Books v cigarettes\", \"Decline of the English Murder\", and \"Some Thoughts on the Common Toad\", all of which have since appeared in dozens of anthologies.\nOther writers who contributed to Tribune in the 1940s include Naomi Mitchison, Stevie Smith, Alex Comfort, Arthur Calder-Marshall, Julian Symons, Elizabeth Taylor, Rhys Davies, Daniel George, Inez Holden, and Phyllis Shand Allfrey.[15]\nKimche left Tribune to join Reuters in 1945, his place being taken by Frederic Mullally. After the Labour landslide election victory of 1945, Bevan joined Clement Attlee's government and formally left the paper, leaving Mullally and Evelyn Anderson as joint editors, with Foot playing Bevan's role of political director. Over the next five years, Tribune was critically involved in every key political event in the life of the Labour government and reached its highest-ever circulation, of some 40,000. Foot persuaded Kimche to return as joint editor in 1946 (after Mullally's departure to the Sunday Pictorial) and in 1948 himself became joint editor with Anderson, after Kimche was fired for disappearing from the office to travel to Istanbul to negotiate the safe passage of two Jewish refugee ships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.\nIn the first few years of the Attlee administration, Tribune became the focus for the Labour left's attempts to persuade Ernest Bevin, the Foreign Secretary, to adopt a \"third force\" democratic socialist foreign policy, with Europe acting independently from the United States and the Soviet Union, most coherently advanced in the pamphlet Keep Left (which was published by the rival New Statesman).\nAfter the Soviet rejection of Marshall Aid and the communist takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948, Tribune endorsed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and took a strongly anti-communist line, with its editor[which?] declaring in November 1948: \"The major threat to democratic socialism and the major danger of war in Europe arises from Soviet policy and not from American policy. It is not the Americans who have imposed a blockade on Berlin. It is not the Americans who have used conspiratorial methods to destroy democratic socialist parties in one country after another. It is not the Americans who have blocked effective action through one United Nations agency after another\".[This quote needs a citation]\n\nBevanism and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament[edit]\nFoot remained in the editorial chair until 1952 when Bob Edwards took over, but he returned after losing his parliamentary seat in Plymouth in 1955. During the early 1950s, Tribune became the organ of the Bevanite left opposition to the Labour Party leadership, turning against the United States over its handling of the Korean War, then arguing strongly against West German rearmament and nuclear arms. However, Tribune remained critical of the Soviet Union as it denounced Stalin on his death in 1953 and in 1956 opposed the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian Revolution and the British government's Suez adventure. The paper and Bevan parted company after his \"naked into the conference chamber\" speech at the 1957 Labour Party conference. For the next five years, Tribune was at the forefront of the campaign to commit Labour to a non-nuclear defence policy, \"the official weekly of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament\" (CND) as the direct actionists in the peace movement put it. CND's general secretary Peggy Duff had been Tribune general manager. Among journalists on Tribune in the 1950s were Richard Clements, Ian Aitken and Mervyn Jones, who related his experience on the paper in his autobiography Chances.\n\n1960s and 1970s[edit]\nAfter Foot was re-elected to Parliament in 1960 for Bevan's old seat of Ebbw Vale, Richard Clements became editor. During the 1960s and 1970s the paper faithfully expressed the ideas of the parliamentary Labour left and allied itself with the new generation of left-wing trade union leaders that emerged on the back of a wave of workplace militancy from the early 1960s onwards.\nAs such, it played a massive role in the politics of the time. Although it welcomed the election of Harold Wilson's Labour government in 1964\u2014\"Tribune takes over from Eton in the cabinet\", exclaimed a headline\u2014the paper became rapidly disillusioned. It denounced the Wilson government's timidity on nationalisation and devaluation, opposed its moves to join the European Communities (EC) and attacked it for failing to take a principled position against the Vietnam War. It also backed the unions' campaigns against the government's prices-and-incomes policies and against In Place of Strife, Barbara Castle's 1969 package of trade union law reforms.\nThe paper continued in the same vein after Edward Heath won the 1970 general election, opposing his Tory government's trade union legislation between 1970 and 1974 and placing itself at the head of opposition to Heath's negotiations for Britain to join the EEC. After Labour regained power in 1974, Tribune played a central part in the \"no\" campaign in the 1975 referendum on British EEC membership.\nHowever, Tribune in this period did not speak to, let alone represent, the concerns of the younger generation of leftists who were at the centre of the campaign against the Vietnam War and the post-1968 student revolt, who found the paper's reformism and commitment to Labour tame and old-fashioned. Circulation, around 20,000 in 1960, was said by 1980 to be around 10,000, but it was in fact much less.\n\nBrief support of Tony Benn[edit]\nClements resigned as editor in 1982 to become a political adviser to Foot (by now Labour leader), a role he continued under Foot's successor as Labour leader, Neil Kinnock. Clements was succeeded in the Tribune chair by Chris Mullin, who steered the paper into supporting Tony Benn (then just past the peak of his influence on the Labour left) and attempted to turn it into a friendly society in which readers were invited to buy shares, much to the consternation of the old Bevanite shareholders, most prominent among them John Silkin and Donald Bruce, who attempted unsuccessfully to take control of the paper. A protracted dispute ensued that at one point seemed likely to close the paper.[16]\n\nPaper of the soft left[edit]\nMullin left in 1984, with circulation at around 6,000, a level it roughly remained for the next ten years). He was replaced by his equally Bennite protege Nigel Williamson, who surprised everyone by arguing for a realignment of the left and took the paper into the soft left camp, supporting Kinnock, a long-time Tribune contributor and onetime board member, as Labour leader against the Bennites. The next two editors Phil Kelly and Paul Anderson took much the same line, although both clashed with Kinnock, particularly over his decision to abandon Labour's non-nuclear defence policy.\nUnder Kelly, Tribune supported John Prescott's challenge to Roy Hattersley as Labour Deputy leader in 1988 and came close to going bust, a fate averted by an emergency appeal launched by a front page exclaiming \"Don't let this be the last issue of Tribune\". Under Anderson, the paper took a strongly pro-European stance, supported electoral reform and argued for military intervention against Serbian aggression in Croatia and Bosnia. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Tribune acted as a clearing house for arguments inside the Labour Party, with contributions from all major players.\n\nBack to basics[edit]\nFrom 1993, Mark Seddon shifted Tribune several degrees back to the left, particularly after Tony Blair became Labour leader in 1994. The paper strongly opposed Blair's abandonment of Clause Four of the Labour Party constitution and resisted his rebranding of the party as New Labour.\nAfter Labour won the 1997 general election, the paper maintained an oppositionist stance, objecting to the Blair government's military interventions and its reliance on spin-doctors. In 2001, Tribune opposed the United States-led invasion of Afghanistan and it was outspoken against the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The paper under Seddon also reverted to an anti-European position very similar to that it adopted in the 1970s and early 1980s and campaigned for Gordon Brown to replace Blair as Labour Leader and Prime Minister.\nTribune changed format from newspaper to magazine in April 2001, but remained plagued by financial uncertainty, coming close to folding again in 2002.[17] However, Seddon and the Chairman of Tribune Publications, Labour MP Peter Kilfoyle, led a team of pro-bono advisers who organised a rescue package with a consortium of trade unions (Unison, Amicus, Aslef,[18] Communication Workers Union, Community, T&GWU),[19] who became majority shareholders in return for a significant investment in the magazine in early 2004.\nWhilst Tribune editor, Seddon was elected several times to the Labour Party National Executive Committee as a candidate of the Grassroots Alliance coalition of left-wing activists. He resigned as editor in summer 2004 and was succeeded by Chris McLaughlin, former political editor of the Sunday Mirror.[20]\nDuring 2007, Tribune spawned two offshoot websites: a Tribune Cartoons blog, put together by cartoonists who draw for the magazine; and a Tribune History blog.\nIn September 2008, the magazine's future was again in doubt thanks to problems with its trade union funding. An attempt by the Unite trade union to render Tribune its wholly owned subsidiary had a mixed response,[21] but on 9 October it was announced that the magazine would close on 31 October if a buyer could not be found.[18] The uncertainty continued until early December 2008, when it emerged that a 51% stake was being sold to an unnamed Labour Party activist for \u00a31, with an undertaking to support the magazine for \u00a340,000 per annum, and with debts written off by the trade union now-former owners.[22]\nTribune's cartoonists were Alex Hughes, Matthew Buck, Jon Jensen, Martin Rowson and Gary Barker.[citation needed]\n\nChanges of ownership (2009\u20132018)[edit]\nIn March 2009, 100% ownership of the magazine passed to Kevin McGrath through a new company, Tribune Publications 2009 Limited, with the intention of keeping Tribune a left-of-centre publication, though broadening the readership.[19][23][24]\nIn late October 2011, the future of Tribune looked bleak once again when McGrath warned of possible closure because subscriptions and income had not risen as had been hoped.[25] Unless a buyer could be found or a cooperative established, the last edition would have been published on 4 November.[26] McGrath committed to paying off the magazine's debts. Another rescue plan saved the magazine at the end of October.[27] In 2013, Tribune claimed a circulation of 5,000.[28]\nIn the autumn of 2016, the journal was owned by the businessman Owen Oyston, who acquired its parent company London Publications Ltd.[29] Oyston filed for bankruptcy and ceased to publish Tribune in January 2018.[30]\n\nRelaunch (2018\u2013present)[edit]\nIn May 2018, it was announced that the Tribune IP had been sold to the American socialist magazine Jacobin.[31] In August 2018, Jacobin publisher Bhaskar Sunkara confirmed the purchase of Tribune in media reports, stating that he aimed to relaunch the magazine ahead of the Labour Party Conference in September.[32][33] At the official re-launch in September 2018, Tribune was announced as a bimonthly magazine with a high-quality design, concentrating on longer-form political analysis and industrial issues coverage, thus differentiating Tribune from other UK leftist media outlets such as Novara Media and the Morning Star.[30] Tribune had 2,000 subscribers, with an aim of reaching 10,000 within a year.[34] The magazine is currently published quarterly.[35] In December 2020, the magazine's editor announced it had 15,000 subscribers.[1]\nTribune often represents the views of Labour-aligned left, most notably for being the publication chosen to launch Rebecca Long-Bailey's leadership campaign.[11][12] High-profile writers for the publication include former leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn,[5][6][7][8] and other members of the Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPs such as Lloyd Russell-Moyle.[36] Issues have contained interviews with international socialist politicians such as Deputy Prime Minister of Spain Pablo Iglesias[9] and former Bolivian President Evo Morales.[10]\nIn February 2021, in an interview on Novara Media, editor Ronan Burtenshaw announced that Tribune was being sued in a libel case. Though he did not comment on the nature of the case, he commented: \"It is not a case that has any substance, we are going to fight it and I think we are going to win it. I can't say anymore, I am legally restricted from saying any more about it, it's not related to the Labour Party before anybody goes on that tangent\".[37]\n\nConnections to the Labour Party[edit]\nLabour Party Conference[edit]\nThe magazine has historically hosted panels and rallies- or fringe events- at Labour Party Conference.[13] In 2021 they invited Labour Party MP and SCG member Andy McDonald[38] and US politician and organiser Nina Turner.[39]\n\nTribune Group of MPs[edit]\nThe Tribune Group of Labour MPs was formed as a support group for the newspaper in 1964.[13][40] During the 1960s and 1970s it was the main forum for the left in the Parliamentary Labour Party, but it split over Tony Benn's bid for the deputy leadership of the party in 1981, with Benn's supporters forming the Campaign Group (later the Socialist Campaign Group). During the 1980s the Tribune Group was the Labour soft left's political caucus, but its closeness to the leadership of Neil Kinnock meant that it had lost any real raison d'etre by the early 1990s. It ceased to promote a list of candidates for shadow cabinet elections.[41]\nThe group was reformed in 2005, led by Clive Efford, MP for Eltham. Invitations to join the newly reformed group were extended to backbench Labour MPs only.[42] The group, which included former cabinet minister Yvette Cooper and former Labour policy coordinator Jon Cruddas, relaunched themselves in April 2017 aiming to reconnect with traditional Labour voters while also appealing to the centre ground. They supported \"opportunity and aspiration\" being central to the party's programme, with policies supporting the \"security of its people at its heart\". While not critical of then-leader Jeremy Corbyn, it was considered as a group of centre-left and moderate Labour MPs who would resist a left-wing successor being selected.[40] The group has no connection with the current incarnation of the newspaper. In 2018 it listed more than 70 MPs as members.[43]\nThe group launched a new website in 2021, listing 78 MPs as members including Labour leader Keir Starmer.[44]\n\nContent[edit]\nAside from its online articles and quarterly newspaper, Tribune has other content and operations.\n\nA World to Win podcast[edit]\nOn 19 August 2020, Tribune launched the podcast A World to Win alongside economist Grace Blakeley and with funding from The Lipman-Miliband Trust.[45] Notable guests on the podcast include Jeremy Corbyn,[46] Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald,[47] philosopher and activist Cornel West,[48] and academic and author Naomi Klein.[49]\n\nList of editors[edit]\nWilliam Mellor (1937\u20131938)\nH.

As of January 2024, it has 1,960,659 articles. It was started on 11 May 2001.[1] In October 2015, it became the sixth-largest Wikipedia by the number of articles. It has the sixth-largest number of edits (136\u00a0million). In June 2020, it was the world's sixth most visited language Wikipedia (after the English, the Japanese, the Spanish, the German and the French Wikipedias).[2]\nIt is the largest Wikipedia written in any Slavic language, surpassing its nearest rival, the Polish Wikipedia, by 20% in terms of the number of articles and fivefold by the parameter of depth.[3] In addition, the Russian Wikipedia is the largest Wikipedia written in Cyrillic[4] or in a script other than the Latin script. In April 2016, the project had 3,377 active editors who made at least five contributions in that month, ranking third behind the English and Spanish versions. As of 2023, it is the most popular Wikipedia in many post-Soviet states, including Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, and the second most popular in others.[citation needed]\nSince the early 2010s, the Russian Wikipedia and its contributing editors have experienced numerous and increasing threats of nationwide blocks and country-wide enforcement of blacklisting by the Russian government, as well as several attempts at Internet censorship, propaganda, and disinformation,[5][6][7][8][9] more recently during the 2014 Russo-Ukrainian war in the Donbas region[10][11][12][13] and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[14]\n\n\nPolicies[edit]\nDifficult issues are resolved through the Arbitration Committee, which handles content disputes, blocks users or prohibits certain users from editing articles on certain topics.[15]\nAdministrators (currently 70) are elected through a vote; a minimum quorum of 30 voters and 66% of support votes are required if the request is to be considered successful. Administrators who have become inactive (i.e. have not used administrative tools, such as \"delete\" or \"block\" buttons, at least 25 times in six months) may lose their privileges by an Arbitration Committee decision.[16]\n\nContent[edit]\nAs of 1 June 2012, some of the biggest categories (which contain more than 5,000 articles) in the Russian Wikipedia are:[17]\n\n176,411 biographical articles. Although the Western name order (given name(s) followed by family name) is generally used in Russian, the Russian Wikipedia uses lexical order (last name, comma, given name(s) and also the patronymic for most people from ex-Soviet countries) for all articles on non-fictional persons. This order has been traditionally used in major Russian-language encyclopedias, like the Great Soviet Encyclopedia.\n144,322 human settlements articles.\n28,187 river articles\n19,302 film articles\n16,925 animal articles\n16,517 scientific articles\n16,133 surname articles\n13,936 footballers' articles\n11,247 Musicians' articles\n10,755 Writers' articles\n9,243 album articles\n9,237 articles on recipients of the Order of Lenin\n7,307 Company's articles\n6,734 plant articles\n6,574 street articles\n6,265 NGC astronomical articles\n6,157 actors articles\n5,719 artist articles\n5,580 music group articles\n5,292 Hero of the Soviet Union articles\n10,340 articles contain material from the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary. More than 47,000 articles were translated from the English Wikipedia.\n\nNamespaces[edit]\nIn addition to common Wikipedia namespaces, the Russian Wikipedia has three custom ones: \"Incubator\" (# 102\u2013103) \u2013 which is used as a training camp for new users and their first articles, \"Project\" (# 104\u2013105) \u2013 for Wikipedia projects and \"Arbitration\" (# 106\u2013107) \u2013 for arbitration requests.\n\nUser pages[edit]\nOn user pages, users are able to see their outreach, the cumulative view count of pages they have edited.\n\nReception[edit]\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (July 2019)\nIn 2015, Roman Leibov\u00a0[ru; et], a professor at the University of Tartu, in an interview opined that articles related to humanities in the Russian Wikipedia are of considerably inferior quality compared to English Wikipedia, and some articles even deteriorate with time. He suggested that this effect is due to overzealous policing of intellectual property rights by the community and bemoaned poor editing skills of some Wikipedians.[18]\nIn 2022, the San Francisco Examiner praised the Russian Wikipedia for \"filling the information vacuum\" while \"independent media abandon Russia or are censored\" during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[19] For the safety of Wikipedians, all editors' names in the page about the Russian invasion in Ukraine are routinely erased.[20]\n\nTimeline[edit]\nNumber of Russian Wikipedia articles in 2005\u20132020\nRussian Wikipedia logo on 11 May 2013\nRussian Wikipedia logo on 1 October 2018\nThis section contains a list of miscellaneous information.

Among other things, the bill stipulates the creation and country-wide enforcement of blacklists, which would block access to forbidden sites. Several aspects of this amendment drew criticism from various civil rights activists and Internet providers.[citation needed]\nSupporters of the amendment stated that it is aimed only at widely prohibited content such as child pornography and similar information, but the Russian Wikimedia chapter has declared that conditions for determining the content falling under this law will create a thing like the \"great Chinese firewall\". They further claimed that existing Russian legal practice demonstrates a high likelihood of a worst-case scenario, resulting in a country-wide ban of Wikipedia.[5][6] The second and the third readings of the law were held in the State Duma on 11 July; no essential corrections were introduced. The law will come into force after three readings in the State Duma, one reading in the Federation Council and presidential approval.[7]\nOn 10 July, Nikolai Nikiforov, Russian Minister for Telecommunications and Mass Media announced in his Twitter account, that the organization of the List of the prohibited websites (that was sited on the Law Project No. 89417-6) will be suspended until 1 November 2012.[7][28] On the same day Yelena Mizulina, a Duma deputy and the head of the subcommittee which sponsored the law, said that the blackout is an attempt to blackmail the Duma and was sponsored by the \"pedophile lobby\".[29]\nAlso, since 2012, Russian foreign agent law resulted in reduced funding available for the Russian Wikipedia and its volunteers, who no longer can receive financial aid from abroad, including their share of funds raised through global Wikipedia fundraisers.[30]\nOn 5 April 2013, it was confirmed by a spokesperson for the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media that Wikipedia had been blacklisted over the article \"\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0441\u0430\" (\"Cannabis smoking\") on Russian Wikipedia.[31][9] On 31 March 2013, The New York Times reported that Russia was 'Selectively Blocking [the] Internet',[8] though Wikipedia itself was not blocked at that time.\nArticles on Russian Wikipedia, and also on other Wikipedia versions, concerning the shoot down of flight MH17 and the 2014 Russo-Ukrainian war in the Donbas region have been targeted by Internet propaganda outlets associated with the Putin-led Russian government.[10][11][12][13] Some of the edits were spotted by a Twitter bot which monitors Wikipedia edits made from Russian government IP addresses.[11][12][13]\nThe entire Russian Wikipedia was blocked in the Russian Federation for a few hours in August 2015 due to the contents of the article on charas.[32]\nIn November 2019, Russian president Vladimir Putin called for a government-run alternative to Wikipedia. The Guardian reported state funds had already been allocated according to official documents published the previous September. The new electronic alternative was intended to be based on the Great Russian Encyclopedia.[33] According to the London Times, the proposal had been abandoned by mid-May 2020,[34] however, according to Great Russian Encyclopedia employee Yekaterina Chukovskaya, only the working group was disbanded and work on the project as a whole will continue.[35]\nIn December 2023, the Russian Wikimedia chapter voted unanimously to dissolve itself after its director had been warned by authorities that he would be designated a \"foreign agent\". He also stated that he was forced to resign from the university where he worked.[36]\n\n2022 fork[edit]\nIn June 2022, Runiversalis, a pro-government partial fork of the Russian Wikipedia, was launched. The site launched with only 9000 articles, a tiny subset of the 1.85 million articles on the Russian Wikipedia, with many articles being taken unmodified from the Russian Wikipedia.[37]\n\nCensorship and disinformation during the Russo-Ukrainian War[edit]\nMain article: Russian information war against Ukraine\nFurther information: Disinformation in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\nThis section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards.

(October 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nIn February and March 2022, in the first week following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and breakout of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Russian Wikipedia editors warned their readers and fellow editors of several, reiterated attempts by the Putin-led Russian government of political censorship, Internet propaganda, disinformation attacks, and disruptive editing towards an article listing of Russian military casualties as well as Ukrainian civilians and children due to the ongoing war.[14] The Wikipedia was generally considered under threat in Russia.[38]\nOn 1 March 2022, Roskomnadzor, the Russian agency for monitoring and censoring mass media, wrote to the Wikimedia Foundation requesting for removal of the article \"\u0412\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0443 (\u0441 2022)\" (\"2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\").[39]\nOn 11 March 2022, Belarusian political police GUBOPiK arrested and detained Mark Bernstein from Minsk, an editor of the Russian Wikipedia, who was contributing to the Wikipedia article about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. GUBOPiK accused him of the \"spread of anti-Russian materials\" and of violating Russian \"fake news\" laws.[40][41][42]\nOn 1 November 2022, a Russian court levied a fine 2 million rubles on the Wikimedia Foundation, for declining to delete two articles on Russian Wikipedia.[43] On 28 February 2023, the Wikimedia Foundation was fined another 2 million rubles after accusations of refusal to delete what the court called \"misinformation\".[44] On 14 April 2023, a similar fine of 2 million rubles was imposed over an article on the Russian occupation of Zaporizhzhia Oblast.[45]\nCalls to block access to Wikipedia have been made by various Russian political actors since the beginning of the invasion. In particular, Valery Fadeyev and Igor Ashmanov, members of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights, called on 4 April 2023 to block the access because of \"systemic bias\".[46]\n\n2023 fork[edit]\nMain article: Ruwiki (website)\nOn 24 May 2023, long-time Wikimedia Russia director Vladimir V. Medeyko announced \"\u0420\u0443\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438\" (\"Ruviki\"), a fork of Russian Wikipedia.[47]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Richey, Jason (11 May 2001). \"[Wikipedia-l] new language wikis\".

KG[2]URLdisclose.tv\nDisclose.tv is a disinformation outlet[8] based in Germany that presents itself as a news aggregator.[2][6] It is known for promoting conspiracy theories[13] and fake news,[19] including COVID-19 misinformation[3][2][6] and anti-vaccine narratives.[22]\nThe website was created in 2007 as a conspiracy forum focused around content such as UFOs and paranormal phenomena. In 2021, it rebranded itself as a news aggregator on its social media platforms and website. Disclose.tv pushes far-right content, conspiracy theories and misleading information together with real news taken from other sources frequently without attribution, and platforms hate speech, including Holocaust denial and neo-Nazism, on its message groups.[2][6][23]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nDisclose.tv in November 2015\nArchived versions of Disclose.tv were found as far back as March 2007 by Logically, a British anti-disinformation organisation. In its initial form, the website operated as a forum focusing on user-generated content discussing topics such as UFOs, paranormal phenomena and other conspiracy theories.[2][6] The website's name references the concept of \"disclosure\" in the UFO community, referring to the time they believe the government will confirm the existence of aliens and release information about them.[2]\nIn April 2012, Disclose.tv announced a redesign of its website.[24] During the 2010s, Disclose.tv's content became more political, with users' posts on the site casting doubt on the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and criticising \"social justice warriors\",[2][6] which Logically said was indicative of \"the right-wing undercurrent of the community\".[2]\nIn 2019, Disclose.tv removed its user-written articles and switched to primarily hosting forums; the website presented some of the forum posts as news articles on its social media accounts.[2] In September 2021, it removed its old versions and cleared out its Twitter, Facebook and YouTube accounts, and announced to its users that it would be operating exclusively as a news website. Around the same time, the website published news articles that were backdated to September 2020, and many of which were plagiarised from a combination of reliable sources and other conspiracy theory websites.[2][6]\nIn January 2022, after Logically sent a request for comment during its investigation of the website, Disclose.tv published an unsigned statement[25] claiming to have never heard of Logically, stating it had \"lost sight\" of the hateful content being posted on its Discord channel despite claiming to have moderators and bots searching for such posts, and apologising for the examples of plagiarism listed in the investigation. The statement also targeted Logically reporter Ernie Piper by name.[2][6] Logically noted that Disclose.tv had blocked many members of its editorial team on Twitter prior to the request for comment, despite claiming to have never heard of Logically.[2] Piper said that the statement, part of which was described as being \"ironic and mocking in tone\", was \"not a normal way for a media organization to respond to critical coverage\", and added that it was \"alarming\" and \"in and of itself a threat\" that Disclose.tv had published his name to its followers.[6]\n\nInfluence[edit]\nPart of a series onAntisemitism\nPart of Jewish history and discrimination\n\nHistory\nTimeline\nReference\nDefinitions\nJerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism\nNexus Document\nThree Ds\nWorking definition of antisemitism\n\nManifestations\nAcademic\nAlt-right\nAmerican\nHistory\n21st century\nArab\nArgentine\nAustralia\nAustrian\nBelarusian\nBelgian\nBritish\nConservative Party\nLabour Party\nCanadian\nChinese\nChilean\nCosta Rican\nChristian\nChristian Identity\nCreativity\nEconomic\nEuropean\nFrench\nDreyfus affair\n21st-century\nGaza War\nGerman\nGreek\nHolocaust denial\nHungarian\nImperial Russian\nIslamic\nItalian\nJapanese\nJewish\nMedieval\nNation of Islam\nNazism\nNeo-Nazi\nStrasserism\nNew Zealand\nNorwegian\nNew\nOlympic\nPakistani\nPalestinian\nRacial\nReligious\nRomanian\nRussian\nSaudi\ntextbook controversy\nSecondary\nSouth African\nSoviet\nStalinist\nSpanish\nSwedish\nTurkish\nUkrainian\nVenezuelan\nWorldwide\nCOVID-19 pandemic incidents\nZionist\n\nAntisemitic tropes\nAndinia Plan\nBlood libel\nCohen Plan\nCultural Bolshevism\nCultural Marxism\nDeicide\nFinance control\nFranklin Prophecy\nHost desecration\nInternational\u200b Jewish conspiracy\nJewish lobby\nJewish war conspiracy theory\nJudensau\nJudeo-Bolshevism\n\u017bydokomuna\nJudeo-Masonism\nKosher tax\nMedia control\nQAnon\nRootless cosmopolitan\nDoctors' plot\nSl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial\nStab-in-the-back myth\nWell poisoning\nWhite genocide\nZOG conspiracy\n\nAntisemitic publications\nThe Barnes Review\nCulture of Critique\nCurrency Wars\nThe Dearborn Independent\nEthnic Cleansing (video game)\nLa France juive\nHitlers Zweites Buch\nHunter (William Luther Pierce)\n1988 Hamas Charter\nThe International Jew\nLa Libre Parole\nThe Light\nMein Kampf\nOn the Jews and Their Lies\nOur Race Will RuleUndisputed Over The World\nProtocols of the Elders of Zion\nThe Secret RelationshipBetween Blacks and Jews\nSiege\nThe Turner Diaries\n\nAntisemitism on the Internet\n4chan (/pol/)\n8chan\nThe Daily Stormer\nDisclose.tv\nEuropa: The Last Battle\nGab\nGoebbels Gap\nGoyimTV\nGroypers\nJew Watch\nMetapedia\nThe Occidental Observer\nRed Ice\nRenegade Tribune\nThe Right Stuff (blog)\nStormfront\nTerrorgram\nTriple parentheses\nTruNews\nThe Unz Review\nVeterans Today\n\nProminent figures\nBaked Alaska\nAndrew Anglin\nLouis Beam\nDon Black\nJames von Brunn\nRichard Girnt Butler\n\u00c9douard Drumont\nDavid Duke\nAdolf Eichmann\nLouis Farrakhan\nHenry Ford\nTheodor Fritsch\nNick Fuentes\nJoseph Goebbels\nHeinrich Himmler\nAdolf Hitler\nArthur J.

Between September 2021 and January 2022, Disclose.tv also maintained a Discord server.[2][6] Disclose.tv's content has been promoted by QAnon conspiracy theorists[27] and shared on COVID-19 misinformation groups on Telegram.[28]\nMiro Dittrich, a senior researcher for the Center for Monitoring, Analysis and Strategy (CeMAS), a German extremism monitoring agency, said that Disclose.tv \"is an exception in terms of its reach\" in relation to other fringe websites, and in how it is \"trying to portray itself as not being a German outlet\" and reusing American far-right sources' talking points. Dittrich and Stephan M\u00fcndges, the head of the Technical University of Dortmund's Journalism Institute, said that the biggest threat from outlets like Disclose.tv is their ability to present conspiracy theories, disinformation and misleading stories as factual news. M\u00fcndges noted, \"They call themselves 'alternative media.' And not everything they publish is completely false, there can be a true story that is then given a strong slant in a certain direction.\"[6]\nIn January 2022, Logically reported that Holocaust denial, neo-Nazism and other forms of hate speech were flourishing on Disclose.tv's Discord and Telegram groups, which included users displaying the swastika and sharing the neo-Nazi propaganda film Europa: The Last Battle on its Telegram group.[2][23] Logically reporter Ernie Piper explained, \"They had a disclaimer saying 'no Nazi BS,' but were at best negligent and at worst freely allowing extreme anti-Semitism on their channels.\"[6] Promoting or platforming Holocaust denial is illegal in Germany, with a punishment of up to five years in prison. Following Logically's request for comment, Disclose.tv closed its Discord server.[2][6] Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) said that Disclose.tv was \"known\" to them, but did not comment further on the extent to which they were monitoring its channels.[6]\n\nContent[edit]\nDisclose.tv in June 2021\nDisclose.tv presents itself as a news aggregator on its social media platforms, promoting conspiracy theories and misleading information together with real news taken from other sources frequently without attribution. It has misrepresented past events as having taken place in the present, such as reporting on a March 2020 curfew in Bavaria in October 2021.[2][6] Logically noted that over half of Disclose.tv's eight most popular tweets featured no attribution as of January 2022, and stated that the website's continued uncritical coverage of conspiracy narratives and UFOs since its September 2021 relaunch revealed its links to pseudoscience and conspiracy theories.[2]\nDittrich stated that the website often creates content \"that doesn't look like it's conspiracy-driven\" and is occasionally shared by \"apolitical people or people on the left who don't know its true purpose\". M\u00fcndges said that it was not very common for a Germany-based website to be producing content in another language for an international audience, adding: \"It is more common that items from the English-language media, for example the 'Stop the steal' narrative, are taken and translated into German\".[6]\n\nPrior to 2021 relaunch[edit]\nIn 2012, Disclose.tv published a story titled \"List of All FEMA Concentration Camps in America Revealed\", which was shared by American far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.[29] In 2015, skeptic Brian Dunning listed Disclose.tv at #6 on his \"Top 10 Worst Anti-Science Websites\" list, calling it \"the National Enquirer of the 21st century. Aliens, UFOs, mermaids, Planet X, ghosts, ancient mysteries... anything you'd expect to find in a supermarket tabloid, you can find on the pages of Disclose.tv.\"[30]\nIn August 2016, Disclose.tv published an article falsely claiming that Edward Snowden was pronounced dead by his girlfriend in Russia.[16] In September, Disclose.tv claimed that NASA had admitted to being in contact with aliens and had not formally announced the information due to believing that everyone was already aware of it; Snopes traced the source of the claim to Waterford Whispers News, an Irish satirical news website.[31]\nIn May 2018, Disclose.tv published an article claiming that vaccines contain \"cancer enzymes\". The fact-checking website Health Feedback noted that the \"enzymes\" referred to in the article seemed to be nagalase, which is not in any vaccine. The claim was repeated on websites such as GlobalResearch.ca and Natural News.[32]\nIn October 2018, Disclose.tv published a story claiming that a Zimbabwean man had created an electric car that did not require charging. PolitiFact rated the claim \"Pants on Fire\", noting that the man's claims had already been reported on in 2015, and that the Zimbabwean technology news website TechZim had noted that the car was outside of the Law of Conservation of Energy.[9]\n\nCOVID-19 misinformation[edit]\nFurther information: COVID-19 misinformation\nDisclose.tv promotes anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown narratives, and misrepresents developments related to COVID-19.[2][6] A study published in March 2021 in the Online Social Networks and Media journal identified Disclose.tv as a purveyor of disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic.[3]\nIn March 2021, Disclose.tv misrepresented a report on vaccine passports published by The Washington Post[33] to falsely claim that the Biden administration would both mandate the use of a passport and maintain the system that runs it.[20]\nIn July 2021, Disclose.tv tweeted that 60% of people being admitted to hospitals in the United Kingdom had received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The claim was based on an incorrect statistic given by Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Advisor for the UK; Vallance issued a statement on Twitter with the correct statistic, which was that 60% of people being hospitalized were unvaccinated.[34][21] Disclose.tv subsequently deleted its tweet.[21]\nIn October 2021, Disclose.tv published an article titled \"German court declares Corona curfew unconstitutional\", which referred to a March 2020 curfew in Bavaria that was retroactively ruled unconstitutional by the State Court.[2][6]\nIn February 2022, Disclose.tv shared on Twitter a Reuters article with the incorrect headline \"Japan's Kowa says that ivermectin effective against Omicron in phase III trial\".[35][5] The tweet was reshared by podcaster Joe Rogan.[35][36] Reuters subsequently corrected its headline and article to note that the research conducted by Kowa was non-clinical research;[35][5] the correction was shared by Disclose.tv, which still falsely stated that ivermectin was \"effective against Omicron in phase III trial\".[5]\n\nOperation[edit]\nDisclose.tv is owned by Futurebytes GmbH & Co. KG, which describes itself as a \"private equity company\" and is based in Passau.[2] Futurebytes is registered with the District Court of Passau and its described purpose is e-commerce, marketing and advertising.[37] Futurebytes is owned by Uwe Braun, a Cologne-based entrepreneur who has made money in Internet hosting businesses,[2] with his company Host Europe being sold to GoDaddy for \u20ac1.69 billion ($1.82 billion) in 2016.[38][2] Braun has not publicly acknowledged his connection to Disclose.tv.[6] In the website's imprint, Braun is named as the legally responsible person.[39]\nIn January 2022, Logically reported that all of the website's articles were attributed to only four writers, none of whom had links to personal websites, social media or bios, and their profile pictures were fakes generated by artificial intelligence. The writers' articles also appeared to have been written by a native German speaker.[2][6]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of fake news websites\nReferences[edit]\n\n^ \"Disclose.tv\". whois.domaintools.com.

Owned and operated by the network's ABC Owned Television Stations division, the station maintains studios in the Lincoln Square neighborhood of Manhattan, adjacent to ABC's corporate headquarters; its transmitter is located at the Empire State Building.\nWABC-TV is best known in broadcasting circles for its version of the Eyewitness News format and for its morning show, syndicated nationally by corporate cousin Disney General Entertainment Content.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nAs WJZ-TV (1948\u20131953)[edit]\nThe station signed on August 10, 1948, as WJZ-TV,[3] the first of three television stations signed on by ABC during that same year, with WENR-TV in Chicago and WXYZ-TV in Detroit being the other two. Channel 7's call letters came from its then-sister radio station, WJZ. In its early years, WJZ-TV was programmed much like an independent station, as the ABC television network was still, for the most part, in its very early stages of development; the ABC-owned stations did air some common programming during this period, especially after the 1949 fall season when the network's prime time schedule began to expand. The station's original transmitter site was located at The Pierre Hotel at 2 East 61st Street, before moving to the Empire State Building a few years later. The station's original studios were located at 77 West 66th Street, with additional studios at 7 West 66th Street. A tunnel linked ABC studios at 7 West 66th Street to the lobby of the Hotel des Artistes, a block north on West 67th Street. Another studio inside the Hotel des Artistes was used for Eyewitness News Conference.[citation needed]\n\nAs WABC-TV (1953\u2013present)[edit]\nA March 1953 advertisement announcing the call letter change from WJZ-TV to WABC-TV[4]\nThe station's call letters were changed to WABC-TV on March 1, 1953,[5][6] after ABC merged its operations with United Paramount Theatres, a firm which was broken off from former parent company Paramount Pictures by decree of the U.S. government.[7] The WJZ-TV callsign was later reassigned to Westinghouse Broadcasting (the original owners of WJZ radio in New York) as an historical nod in 1957 for their newly acquired television station in Baltimore \u2013 a station that was, by coincidence, an ABC affiliate until 1995.\nAs part of ABC's expansion program, initiated in 1977, ABC built 7 Lincoln Square on the southeast corner of West 67th Street and Columbus Avenue, on the site of an abandoned moving and storage warehouse. At about the same time, construction was started at 30 West 67th Street on the site of a former parking lot. Both buildings were completed in June 1979 and WABC-TV moved its offices from 77 West 66th Street to 7 Lincoln Square.\nOn September 11, 2001, the transmitter facilities of WABC-TV, as well as eight other local television stations and several radio stations, were destroyed when two hijacked airplanes crashed into and destroyed the north and south towers of the World Trade Center. WABC-TV's transmitter maintenance engineer Donald DiFranco died in the attack.[8] In the immediate aftermath, the station fed its signal to WNYE-TV, WHSE-TV, WHSI-TV, and the New Jersey Network[9] before establishing temporary facilities at the Armstrong Tower in Alpine, New Jersey. The station eventually re-established transmission facilities at the Empire State Building, its original home when it signed on the air in 1948.[10]\nABC News Now was launched in 2004 on digital subchannels of the ABC O&O stations.[11] On January 31, 2005, ABC removed ABC News Now from O&O and affiliated stations' subchannels as the channel ended its experimental phase originally.[12] The group changed its programming on secondary channels to ABC Plus, a local news and public affairs format. ABC teamed up with AccuWeather to launch a multicast service on WABC's third subchannel between December 9, 2005, and March 31, 2006.[13]\nOn May 27, 2007, WABC-TV's studios suffered major damage as the result of a fire that knocked the station off the air shortly before the start of the 11\u00a0p.m. newscast. According to preliminary reports, the fire may have been ignited by a spotlight coming into contact with a curtain inside the news studio; the station's website later reported the cause as an \"electrical malfunction\". The station's building was evacuated and the fire was brought under control, though the studio was said to be \"badly damaged\", having suffered smoke and water damage. WABC-TV resumed broadcasting at around 1\u00a0a.m. on May 28, 2007 (initially carrying the network's 10\u00a0pm. West Coast feed of Brothers & Sisters, followed by the full broadcast of World News Now). Due to the fire, the station broadcast Eyewitness News from the newsroom, while Live! with Regis and Kelly, whose set was also affected, moved to the set of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. Starting with the 5\u00a0p.m. newscast on June 20, 2007, the station resumed the Eyewitness News and Live! broadcasts from its main studios at Columbus Avenue and 66th Street.[14]\nThe Live Well Network (LWN) was launched on April 27, 2009, in high definition by ABC's O&O stations on the stations' .2 subchannels.[15][16]\nWABC-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, VHF channel 7, at 12:30\u00a0p.m. on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television.[17] The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 45 to VHF channel 7.[18][19] WABC's digital signal was initially difficult to receive over-the-air in New York City. The station was requested by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast at a lower power; WABC was among many stations which have found it necessary to increase power to restore coverage to the same level as its former analog signal. On June 29, 2009, WABC filed an application with the FCC to increase power from 11.69\u00a0kW to 27\u00a0kW.[20] On January 31, 2010, the FCC granted a special temporary authority (STA) for the station to increase power to 26.9\u00a0kW.[21]\nIn May 2013, WABC-TV and Philadelphia sister station WPVI-TV became the first two ABC-owned stations to offer live, web-based streaming of programming to authenticated subscribers of participating cable and satellite television providers as provided through the relaunched Watch ABC mobile apps.[22][23]\nABCOTS indicated in January 2015 that its stations' 3rd subchannel would affiliated with Laff network upon launch on April 15, 2015, but until then LWN would run on both subchannels.[24] ABC Stations rebranded Live Well Network on .2 as Localish on February 17, 2020, to add an outlet for the Localish lifestyle content.[25]\n\nProgramming[edit]\nWABC has long presented events such as the Columbus Day Parade and Puerto Rican Day Parade and beginning in 2017, they became the first television station to air the New York City LGBT Pride March.[26] In addition, the station is also producing local programs such as Here and Now, a program covering the latest issues, trends and news stories impacting the local black community, Tiempo, a weekly program that focus on the issues affecting local Hispanic citizens, and Up Close, a public affairs program on the latest issues with the newsmakers. The station also formerly produced Viewpoint, a weekly program that highlighted the cultural and community efforts in New York, Long Island and New Jersey (each of these regions rotated weekly).\nAs of 2023, aside from Live with Kelly and Mark, WABC's first-run syndicated programs include Tamron Hall, Jeopardy!, and Wheel of Fortune.\n\nLive with Kelly and Mark[edit]\nMain article: Live with Kelly and Mark\nThis section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nWABC-TV produces the nationally syndicated talk show Live with Kelly and Mark.[27] Until the station's newscasts were moved to a separate studio in 2011, the program originated in the same ground-floor studio at 7 Lincoln Square as Eyewitness News, thus creating a situation which forced local news updates broadcast during Good Morning America and Live to be produced from the WABC-TV newsroom and the morning show's presence also limited the size of the Eyewitness News set.\nThe program's roots originated with A.M. New York, which debuted in 1970 as a local version of NBC's Today show;[28] its first host was John Bartholomew Tucker, who remained with the program until 1972. After Tucker's departure, a succession of hosts came and went, the most successful of whom was Stanley Siegel, who hosted from 1975 to 1978 (for a year beginning in 1977, the series was called The Stanley Siegel Show).[29] After 1980, the show was retitled Good Morning New York, whose co-hosts in the last years of its run in that form included Spencer Christian, Andrea Kirby, Judy Licht, Dick Wolfsie and longtime Eyewitness News reporter and anchor Doug Johnson. After years of a losing ratings battle against Donahue on WNBC-TV, WABC-TV cancelled Good Morning New York in early 1983.[30]\nThe current show began as the station's second attempt at a local morning show a month later, aptly titled The Morning Show (using the \"Circle 7\" logo in the actual text for one of the \"o\"s) and was originally hosted by Regis Philbin and Cyndy Garvey. After Garvey's departure a year later, she was replaced by Ann Abernathy, who in turn, left in 1985 to return to Los Angeles. That year, Kathie Lee Johnson (who would marry Frank Gifford a year later) became Philbin's new co-host.\nIn 1988, Buena Vista Television began syndicating the show nationally as Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. Gifford left the show in 2000 and was eventually replaced by Kelly Ripa. Philbin left the show in November 2011 and the show aired for nearly a year as Live! with Kelly until former New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan became Ripa's permanent co-host in September 2012. In May 2016, Strahan left the show to become a full-time anchor at Good Morning America, thus leaving Ripa as the solo host again. On May 1, 2017, it was announced that Ryan Seacrest would become the new host of the show; to accommodate his syndicated radio show On Air with Ryan Seacrest (which normally originates from Los Angeles), an additional studio was built within WABC's facilities.[31] Seacrest departed Live on April 14, 2023, and three days later Ripa's husband, Mark Consuelos, became the new co-host of the show.\n\nSports programming[edit]\nWABC-TV serves as the local over-the-air broadcaster of Monday Night Football games, airing simulcasts of the ESPN-televised games carried nationally on ABC. However, ESPN-only MNF telecasts involving the Giants or Jets air locally on WPIX.[32] Previously, the station carried coverage of the Giants' victory in Super Bowl XXV.\nSince 2013, WABC-TV serves as the exclusive local English-language carrier of the annual New York City Marathon. The station preempts a weekend edition of Good Morning America and delays This Week to schedule time for the live broadcast. The marathon is also simulcast on ESPN2 nationally (although viewers in the Tri-State area cannot see it via ESPN2 because the simulcast is blacked out locally).\nWABC-TV currently airs any New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets games televised via the NBA on ABC. The station has aired the Knicks' appearances in the 1970, 1972 and 1973 NBA Finals (where the Knicks won in 1970 and 1973), as well as the then-New Jersey Nets' appearance in the 2003 NBA Finals.\nWABC-TV aired New York Rangers, New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils games carried through the NHL on ABC; this included the Devils' victories in the 2000 and 2003 Stanley Cup Finals, as well as their appearance in the 2001 Stanley Cup Finals. Beginning in 2021, it officially reassumed this duty, this time as the OTA simulcast partner of the NHL on ESPN.\nThrough the ABC portion of the MLS on ESPN package, WABC-TV aired New York City FC's victory in the 2021 MLS Cup and the New York Red Bulls' appearance in the 2008 MLS Cup.\nWABC-TV also previously aired any New York Yankees and New York Mets games through ABC's baseball contract; this included the Yankees' victory in the 1977 World Series and appearance in the 1981 World Series.\n\nWABC-TV Eyewitness News reporting from Park Row in Manhattan\nNews operation[edit]\nWABC-TV presently broadcasts 48 hours, 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 7 hours, 35 minutes each weekday and 5+1\u20442 hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). The station partners with Philadelphia sister station, WPVI-TV \u2013 which popularized the Action News format \u2013 in the production and broadcast of statewide New Jersey political debates. When the two stations broadcast a statewide office debate, such as for Governor or U.S. Senate, they pool resources and have anchors or reporters from both stations participate in the debate. Additionally, the two stations share coverage of news from New Jersey where their markets overlap, pooling reporters, live trucks, and helicopters.\n\nNews department history[edit]\nBeginning to 1968[edit]\nWABC-TV launched Report to New York, its first regular news program, on October 26, 1959, featuring Scott Vincent with news, Howard Cosell with sports, and Lynn Dollar with the weather. Report to New York aired Monday through Friday at 11\u00a0pm. By January 1961, channel 7 expanded Report to New York with a 15-minute early edition at 6:15\u00a0p.m. on weeknights, and on Saturday and Sunday evenings.\nOn October 22, 1962, WABC-TV expanded its weeknight news to 45 minutes, and retitled it The Big News. Newcomers Bill Beutel and Jim Burnes[33] were the anchors, with Cosell continuing on sports and Rosemary Haley as \"weather girl\".[34] However, this effort failed to draw viewers from the ratings leader WCBS-TV and second-place WNBC-TV.\n\nThe Eyewitness News era[edit]\nIn early 1968, Beutel left the station to become the London bureau chief for ABC News and was replaced by Roger Grimsby, who was transferred by ABC from San Francisco sister station KGO-TV. In a complete revamp, Grimsby was joined by Tex Antoine doing weather, celebrity gossip columnist Rona Barrett, New York Daily News columnist Jimmy Breslin with political commentary and reviews by Martin Bookspan and Allan Jeffries, while Cosell continued doing sports. Known as Roger Grimsby and the Noisemakers, this format didn't help the ratings, which plunged to an all-time low.[35]\nLater that year, newly hired news director Al Primo brought to WABC-TV the Eyewitness News format and branding, in which reporters present their stories directly to the viewers. Having experienced great success introducing the format during his time at KYW-TV in Philadelphia, Primo this time added a twist \u2013 a degree of conversational chatter among the anchors, known as \"happy talk\". The \"Tar Sequence\" cue from the musical score of the 1967 film Cool Hand Luke, composed by Lalo Schifrin, was introduced as the theme music. The score included a telegraphic-style melody appropriate for a newscast. The Eyewitness News format and theme music were quickly adopted by ABC's other four owned-and-operated stations at the time: KGO-TV, WLS-TV in Chicago, WXYZ-TV in Detroit and KABC-TV in Los Angeles (though KGO-TV and WXYZ-TV did not use the Eyewitness News title for their programs). The format quickly rejuvenated a station that had long been an also-ran to WCBS-TV and WNBC-TV. Within a year, Channel 7 had shot to first place in the ratings for the first time in its history, displacing longtime leader WCBS-TV. It spent most of the decade going back and forth with WCBS-TV for first place. For a time in the 1980s, it fell into last place among the network-owned stations, but still fought with WNBC-TV for second place.\nRetaining only Grimsby, Cosell, and Antoine from the earlier Noisemakers format, Primo also hired Tom Dunn away from WCBS-TV to serve as Grimsby's co-anchor. After Dunn departed for WOR-TV in 1970, Bill Beutel returned to the station as his replacement and for the next 16 years, Grimsby and Beutel were the faces of Eyewitness News.\nThe Grimsby-Beutel team were split up for several months in 1975 after ABC had reassigned Beutel to its new morning show, AM America that January. The station brought in WXYZ-TV's Bill Bonds and veteran Boston anchor Tom Ellis to help replace Beutel, with Grimsby teaming with Ellis at 6\u00a0p.m. and Bonds at 11\u00a0pm.[36] When AM America was canceled and replaced with Good Morning America in November 1975, Beutel was re-teamed with Grimsby at 6\u00a0pm, with Ellis joining Bonds at 11\u00a0pm. Bonds returned to Detroit in June 1976[37] and was replaced by Larry Kane,[38] who lasted only one year as the sole 11\u00a0p.m. anchor before returning to his home market of Philadelphia. Ellis remained until May 1977[39] and Kane's successor, Ernie Anastos, began his New York career at the station; he co-anchored at 11\u00a0p.m. with Rose Ann Scamardella and later Kaity Tong, for his entire 12-year tenure there.\nOn November 30, 1981, the station became the second in the city to expand its late afternoon/evening newscasts by adding of a 5\u00a0p.m. edition, first presented by Rose Ann Scamardella and Storm Field, later succeeded by Kaity Tong and Tom Snyder, the latter only lasting several months before being replaced by 11\u00a0p.m. co-anchor Ernie Anastos.\nIn 1985, the station lured WLS-TV's news director, Bill Applegate, from Chicago to New York City. Applegate claimed credit for taking WLS-TV from last to first in only two years and ABC hoped he could work the same magic at the flagship station. In the wake of declining ratings, Grimsby was fired on April 16, 1986, a move for which Applegate drew considerable ire and Grimsby was quickly hired by rival WNBC-TV. In 1987, Channel 7 surged back into first place. It has been the ratings leader in New York City since then, and has grown to become the most-watched broadcast television station in the United States.[40] Beutel stepped down from the anchor desk in 2001, which concluded the longest tenure for a main anchor in New York City television history at that time. His record has since been surpassed by WNBC's Chuck Scarborough and WXTV's Rafael Pineda. Scarborough's uninterrupted run behind the desk is the longest in New York television (since 1974). Pineda is second, having started with WXTV in 1972, retiring in 2013 after 41 years.\n\n2000\u2013present[edit]\nWABC-TV's news department is respected for its straightforward presentation (especially during breaking news). For the last decade, it has waged a spirited battle for first place, but for most of the time has held onto the lead, helped in part by lead-ins from the highly rated talk and entertainment shows. For over 24 years (December 1986 to May 2011), the lead-in for the 5\u00a0p.m. Eyewitness News broadcast had been The Oprah Winfrey Show at 4\u00a0p.m. and its strong ratings brought viewers along to the 5\u00a0p.m. newscast.\nThe newscasts were replayed on one of channel 7's digital subchannels, another which also carried local weather and news channel. WABC-TV's website had a link for live streaming video of \"Channel 7 Eyewitness News NOW\", which offered live local and national weather updated from AccuWeather alongside local news. The format of \"Eyewitness News NOW\" is similar to the defunct NBC Weather Plus. On February 24, 2011, AccuWeather and ABC both replaced ENN as well as similar news channels on WABC-TV's sister stations, KABC-TV in Los Angeles and WLS-TV in Chicago, replacing them in all three cities with a standard definition, letterboxed simulcast of the Live Well Network, and then on April 15, 2015, these stations were replaced by Laff.\nOn December 2, 2006, WABC-TV became the second station in the New York City market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. On September 7, 2010, WABC-TV expanded its weekday morning newscast, moving its start time to 4:30\u00a0am. Three days earlier on September 4, 2010, WABC added an hour-long extension of its Saturday morning newscast from 9 to 10\u00a0am.[41] On May 26, 2011, WABC-TV added another hour of local news at 4\u00a0p.m. to replace Oprah, which aired its last original episode the previous day.\nOn September 24, 2011, the station began broadcasting its newscasts and public affairs programs from a new street-level window studio at a former Disney Store location in the ABC building on 66th Street and Columbus Avenue. The space previously used for news broadcasts was used to expand the Live with Kelly studio.[42][43] In January 2012, the station also expanded its weekend 11\u00a0p.m. newscasts to an hour. On September 8, 2014, the station expanded its Noon newscast to one full hour from the previous half-hour.[44]\nWABC-TV will leave its longtime home of Lincoln Square upon the completion of a new campus for Disney, located at Hudson Square in Lower Manhattan in 2025.[45]\nOn January 31, 2022, WABC announced they would be launching a streaming channel titled \"ABC 7 New York 24/7 Stream\". As part of the launch of the service, WABC announced a new 6:30\u00a0p.m. newscast, available only through the stream.[46]\nOn September 11, 2023, WABC-TV, along with sister stations WPVI-TV and WTVD in Durham, North Carolina, launched an additional hour-long newscast at 10 a.m. which took over the time slot previously occupied by Tamron Hall. The broadcast will continue to deliver news in a traditional format, and will also allow more focus to be placed on local newsmakers, and further discussion on topics addressed on Good Morning America and Live with Kelly and Mark.[47] WABC delayed its launch by one day, due to coverage of events in the city, marking the anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\nNotable current on-air staff[edit]\nThis section may contain information not important or relevant to the article's subject.

WABC-TV's signal was removed from Cablevision's New York area systems (including iO Digital Cable) after the two sides failed to reach terms on a new retransmission consent agreement; the station was replaced by either a blank screen or a looping video containing a message from Cablevision about the removal. To avoid interruption of programming, the station urged Cablevision subscribers in the station's viewing area (totaling up to three million subscribers) to switch to other services, such as Verizon FiOS and DirecTV or simply view the station over the air through an over-the-air digital antenna and if necessary, a digital converter box, for older television sets.[74] WABC's sister station, WPVI-TV in Philadelphia, was also pulled from Cablevision's New Jersey systems in Mercer, Ocean and Monmouth counties.[75]\nLater that same day at approximately 8:50\u00a0pm, 20 minutes into ABC's broadcast of the 82nd Academy Awards, Cablevision and ABC reached a deal, restoring WABC and WPVI's signals for Cablevision subscribers after a nearly 21-hour blackout.[76]\n\nTime Warner Cable (2010)[edit]\nIn July 2010, ABC's parent company Disney announced that it was involved in a carriage dispute with Time Warner Cable (now Spectrum), its first with that provider in 10 years. This dispute involved four ABC owned-and-operated stations (WABC-TV and sister stations KABC-TV, WTVD and WTVG in Toledo, Ohio [the latter station would be sold by ABC the next year]), Disney Channel and the ESPN networks. If a deal was not in place, the affected stations and cable channels would have been removed from Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks systems across the country. On September 2, 2010, Disney and Time Warner Cable reached a long-term agreement to keep the channels on Time Warner Cable systems.[77]\n\nCharter Spectrum (2023)[edit]\nOn August 31, 2023, Disney removed all of its channels, including WABC-TV, two other ABC-owned stations, and the ESPN networks, from Spectrum cable systems due to a carriage dispute, its first with the provider since 2010 when its predecessor, Time Warner Cable, was involved in a dispute with Disney.[78] On September 11, 2023, the stations and their sister cable channels were restored by Charter Communications (the parent company of Spectrum) after the company and Disney reached an agreement.[79]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nJournalism portalNew York City portalTelevision portal\nCircle 7 logo\nList of television stations in New York (by region)\nMedia in New York City\nNew Yorkers in journalism\nWABC (770\u00a0AM)\nWPLJ (95.5\u00a0FM)\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"FCC handles its hottest FM-TV case.\" Broadcasting \u2013 Telecasting.

It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, which provides certain services to TBD outlet KXVO (channel 15) under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Mitts Telecasting Company. Both stations share studios on Farnam Street in Omaha, while KPTM's transmitter is located on Pflug Road, south of Gretna and I-80.\nKPTM went on air as Omaha's first independent station in 1986. It was built by and named for California-based Pappas Telecasting. KPTM affiliated with Fox in 1988, after Pappas originally sat out the network's launch, and began airing local newscasts in June 1990. After the bankruptcy of Pappas, Titan Broadcast Management acquired the station in 2009, selling most of its broadcasting properties to Sinclair in 2013. While KPTM aired a 9 p.m. newscast for more than 30 years, a major attempt at expansion in the late 1990s was rolled back for economic reasons less than 18 months later, and for the last decade, the news programs were presented by talent outside the Omaha market.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nConstruction and Pappas ownership[edit]\nPappas Telecasting began conducting community surveys in February 1979 with an eye to establishing a station on ultra high frequency (UHF) channel 15 in Omaha; the company also leased the building at 2615 Farnam Street, recently vacated by KMTV.[2] Competition grew crowded for channel 15, with three groups in the running by June 1979[3] and a total of eight by early November, when Pappas switched from seeking channel 15 to channel 42.[4] There was only one other group that had filed for channel 42: Christian Broadcasting of the Midlands, which in March filed an application proposing a Christian television station.[5]\nPappas was selected over Christian Broadcasting by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit in 1984 and announced its plans to put channel 42 on the air by October 1985.[6] However, the battle between the two applicants continued because Christian Broadcasting of the Midlands appealed the FCC's decision to the commission's review board and then to the full FCC.[7]\nAfter Christian lost, construction began on KPTM (taking its name from the owner, Pappas Telecasting of the Midlands). A tower was built in Sarpy County, Nebraska, while a former insurance office at 4625 Farnam was renovated for the TV station.[8] Prior to the launch of KPTM, Omaha had no independent stations. Only KBGT-TV \"Big 8\", which primarily served the central and western part of the state, operated as an independent in Nebraska, and two independent stations operated in Iowa.[9]\nKPTM began broadcasting on April 6, 1986.[10] Even though it was the only non-network station in Omaha, it refused to join the fledgling Fox network at its launch that October. Doing so meant KPTM would have had to carry Fox's first and initially only offering, The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers, opposite The Tonight Show. At the time, The Tonight Show was hosted by Johnny Carson, a native of nearby Corning, Iowa, who spent his youth in Norfolk, Nebraska, and had begun his career at Omaha's WOW-TV in the early 1950s. Station manager Gary Nielsen told the Lincoln Journal Star, \"Why would you program Joan Rivers in Johnny Carson's hometown?\"[11] In the July 1986 Arbitron ratings, KPTM was the highest-rated independent station in the country in prime time and the third-highest in total-day audience share.[11]\nIn September 1988, the three Pappas independents\u2014KPTM; KMPH-TV in Fresno, California; and WHNS in Asheville, North Carolina\u2014joined Fox.[12] Pappas expanded its programming in the Omaha market when it began operating the new KXVO (channel 15) in 1995; the station, owned by Cocola Broadcasting, was an affiliate of The WB.[13]\n\nTitan and Sinclair ownership[edit]\nPappas Telecasting filed for bankruptcy in May 2008.[14] Several Pappas stations, including KPTM and its local marketing agreement to program KXVO, were sold to Titan Broadcast Management in 2009.[15] During this time, co-owned KCWL-TV in Lincoln was converted to an in-market Fox affiliate as KFXL-TV.[16] Cable carriage of KPTM's high-definition feed in Lincoln was discontinued in 2012 in favor of KFXL-TV, though KPTM continued to be offered in standard definition.[17]\nAlso in 2009, the station completed its conversion to digital television on June 12.[18] The station's digital transmissions remained on channel 43, using virtual channel 42,[19] until KPTM relocated its signal from channel 43 to channel 26 on June 2, 2019, as a result of the 2016 United States wireless spectrum auction.[20]\nTitan TV Broadcast Group announced the sale of most of its stations, including KPTM, to the Sinclair Broadcast Group on June 3, 2013; the purchase includes the local marketing agreement with KXVO,[21] which remained under Mitts Telecasting LLC ownership after the sale. Sinclair announced the closing of the sale on October 3.[22]\n\nNews operation[edit]\nUnder Pappas[edit]\nAt the end of 1989, new KPTM general manager Hal Protter announced that the station would debut a weeknight 9 p.m. newscast in 1990.[23] Protter was familiar with news on independent stations, having supervised newsrooms at KPLR-TV in St. Louis, KRBK-TV in Sacramento, and WVTV in Milwaukee. On June 14, 1990, the Nine O'Clock Nightly News debuted as a half-hour program;[24] the newscast title had previously been used by Protter at WVTV.[23] The month before, the station had aired its first live news program when it broadcast cut-ins of Nebraska election returns into its prime time programming.[25] Fox took interest in the startup newsroom in Omaha as a model for Fox stations in smaller markets seeking to add newscasts.[26] The half-hour newscast expanded to an hour in October 1995, a change that had been planned for several years.[27][28]\nThe KPTM news department made plans for expansion in 1998 with the launch of a 3+1\u20442-hour morning newscast, Good Day, as well as an 11 a.m. newscast. Pappas invested $1.5 million in new equipment and a new news set and doubled the news staffing. The previous set was then shipped to the Pappas-owned Nebraska Television Network (NTV) in Kearney.[29] However, the news expansions were rolled back for economic reasons in March 2000, resulting in 28 employees being laid off.[30] Generally, KPTM's newscasts had a higher proportion of national news stories than their competitors.[31] Another expansion was attempted with a 4 p.m. newscast in 2007,[32] but this was canceled in 2009 as the station laid off 22 staffers due to the Great Recession.[33]\n\nOutsourcing and shutdown[edit]\nOn July 6, 2010, station management announced it would cease presenting the newscast in Omaha and outsource production of the 9 p.m. newscast to the Independent News Network of Davenport, Iowa, starting September 6. The move allowed KPTM to convert its newscasts to high-definition production but resulted in layoffs in Omaha.[31] In a 2011 interview with Broadcasting & Cable, general manager Jeff Miller credited the outsourcing to INN with allowing KPTM to \"stay in the news game\".[34]\nBy July 2013, after the announcement that KPTM would be acquired by Sinclair, the station announced it would discontinue its agreement with INN and return production of the 9 p.m. in-house, with station management citing viewers' dislike of the outsourced production model. At the outset, the \"On the Street\" setup would be retained, but the newscasts would be produced with the assistance of KPTM's Fresno sister station, KMPH-TV.[35] As late as 2022, the Fresno-produced news program was described by its general manager as \"a nice looking, locally flavored, profitable newscast\".[36]\nSinclair shut down the Fresno-produced KPTM newscast on May 12, 2023, making Omaha one of five markets where all newscasts on the Sinclair-owned station were discontinued in favor of The National Desk.[37]\n\nTechnical information[edit]\nSubchannels[edit]\nThe station's signal is multiplexed:\n\n\nSubchannels of KPTM[38]\n\n\nChannel\n\nRes.\n\nAspect\n\nShort name\n\nProgramming\n\n\n42.1\n\n720p\n16:9\nFOX42\nFox\n\n\n42.2\n\n480i\nMyTV\nMyNetworkTV & Dabl\n\n\n42.3\n\n720p\nCW\nThe CW\n\n\n42.4\n\n480i\nComet\nComet\n\n\n15.1\n\n480i\n16:9\nTBD\nTBD (KXVO)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Broadcast on behalf of another station\nThe main subchannel of KXVO, with programming from The CW, became the 42.3 subchannel of KPTM on September 14, 2021.[39] KXVO then began broadcasting programming from the Sinclair-owned diginet TBD, converting to ATSC 3.0 broadcasting in April 2022.[40]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Facility Technical Data for KPTM\".

Although it claims to trace its origins to 1840,[1] it was founded in 1869 as The Ellicott City Times, a weekly newspaper. In 1958, its name was changed to The Howard County Times and it was acquired by the then-independent local publisher Patuxent Publishing Company in 1978, along with other local papers.[2] As of January\u00a02016,[update] The Howard County Times is currently a unit of the Baltimore Sun Media Group[3] and maintains its online news page on The Baltimore Sun website.[4] The Howard County Times website and X (formerly Twitter) page provides news items from the Times as well as several other local area newspapers and magazines, including the Columbia Flier, the Laurel Leader, and Howard magazine.[5]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nThe Howard County Times traces its history to 1840, when the Howard Free Press was established by Edward Waite and Matthew Fields in Ellicott City, the major town along the upper branches of the Patapsco River (and future county seat) of Howard County, Maryland, just west of Baltimore, the major city and port of Maryland.[6] The newspaper was published until 1842. Between 1840 and the Civil War, a succession of newspapers opened and closed in Ellicott City (then called Ellicott's Mills) and Howard County. After the Patapsco Enterprise closed in fall 1861, no newspaper was published in Howard County until 1865 when the Howard County Record was founded by the publisher Isaiah Wolfersberger. In 1869, John R. Brown, Jr., a Howard County native who had served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War, purchased the Howard County Record and changed its name to The Ellicott City Times. Under Brown, the newspaper was successful. After Brown's death in 1877, the paper had a number of owners. In 1882, Edwin Warfield, (1848\u20131920), later Governor of Maryland at the turn of the 19th century (and future banker and founder/publisher of The Daily Record, a legal/business/finance newspaper (published Monday\u2013Friday) in Baltimore purchased the paper.\nIn 1920, the paper was owned by Judge James A. Clark Sr., Paul Talbot and Paul G. (\"Pete\") Stromberg, (1892\u20131952), took over as editor. Stromberg became a state senator and editor of The Sun, a major daily newspaper in Baltimore which coincidentally, decades later would see The Sunpapers, along with its later syndicate chain owner, the Tribune Company (of the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times), would in turn absorb the Howard County Times in a later merger with its last independent publisher, the Patuxent Publishing Company of Columbia, Maryland.[7] In 1940, Stromberg took control of the Maryland Printing and Publishing Company which gave him sole ownership of the Howard County paper. Stromberg in turn created or purchased over the next few post-war years, 11 new local papers in the suburban (Baltimore County) or outlying Baltimore City communities/neighborhoods ringing around Baltimore, naming his syndicate the Stromberg Newspapers and employed his nephew Charles L Gerwig as editor. Some of these were the Arbutus Times, Catonsville Times, Owings Mills Times, Towson Times, The Jeffersonian, Northeast Record, Northeast Booster, [North] Baltimore Messenger (Baltimore City) and the Laurel Leader (Anne Arundel County/Prince George's County).[8] On November 12, 1958, the name of The Ellicott City Times was changed to The Howard County Times to reflect increased county-wide coverage.[9]\nIn 1965, The Columbia Times was created as a spin-off newspaper. Stromberg's daughter, Doris Stromberg Thompson, took over as editor from 1966 to 1978.[10]\n\nAcquisition by Patuxent Publishing[edit]\nThe Columbia Flier was established in 1969, two years after Rouse began development of Columbia was formed a coupon flier for the new development of Columbia. As the new town grew, owner Zeke Orlinsky's paper served a larger market than the Times, eventually purchasing the newer paper.[11] The editor, Tom Graham, used the paper to encourage the growth of Columbia, promoting political candidates who supported the project.[12]\nIn 1978, the Rouse Company architect, Robert Moon, designed a new headquarters for the Patuxent Publishing Company in a modernist building at 10750 Little Patuxent Parkway leading into central Columbia. Moon's wife worked at the firm as well, becoming editor of the Columbia Flier and then general manager of Patuxent Publishing. The Baltimore Sun media group purchased Patuxent Publishing Company, including the Howard County Times and Columbia Flier, integrating the local papers. The Columbia Flier building was put up for sale, but no tenants were signed on for over three years.[13] In 2014, the former Baltimore Sun editor, and now public relations director for Howard County, David Nitkin, announced that the county executive, Ken Ulman, directed the purchase of the Flier building by the county for $2.8 million.[14] County councilperson Mary Kay Sigaty announced the building where her husband Tom Graham used to work as an editor would be rebuilt as a replacement headquarters for the county's Economic Development Authority and the Maryland Center for Entrepreneurship.[15]\nThe Howard County Times has since been integrated as a unit of the newly organized local publisher Baltimore Sun Media Group under the former Times Mirror Group of the Los Angeles Times, and later under the purchase of the Tribune Company syndicate of the Chicago Tribune.\n\nPublishers[edit]\nPaul G.

Owned by Nexstar Media Group, it is sister to the company's sole radio property, news/talk/sports station WGN (720 AM). WGN-TV's studios are located on West Bradley Place in Chicago's North Center community; as such, it is the only major commercial television station in Chicago which bases its main studio outside the Loop. Its transmitter is located atop the Willis Tower in the Loop.\nLike concept progenitor WTBS in Atlanta, WGN-TV was a pioneering superstation; on November 8, 1978, it became the second U.S. television station to be made available via satellite transmission to cable and direct-broadcast satellite subscribers nationwide. Later renamed WGN America, the former superstation feed was converted into a conventional basic cable network in December 2014, enabling it to be added to local cable providers,[4][5][6][7] and later soft re-launched as NewsNation in September 2020. A charter affiliate of both The WB and of successor network The CW, WGN-TV reverted to being an independent station in 2016.\nWGN-TV, WGN radio and the now-defunct regional cable news channel Chicagoland Television (CLTV) were the three flagship properties of Tribune Broadcasting, itself part of the Tribune Media conglomerate (formerly known as the Tribune Company until August 2014), until the company's purchase by Nexstar was completed in September 2019.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nEarly years (1948\u20131956)[edit]\nThe Chicago Tribune Company, headed by Chicago Tribune editor and publisher Robert R. McCormick and the owner of WGN and WGNB[8][a] submitted an application to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on September 13, 1946, and under the \"WGN Incorporated\" subsidiary, to build a television station on VHF channel 9.[9][b] After the FCC awarded the permit on November 8, the group originally requested to assign WGNA as the station's call sign.[10][11] By January 1948, however, the company decided to call its new television property WGN-TV after WGN, which had been owned by the Tribune since 1924.[12] The three-letter base call sign served as an initialism for \"World's Greatest Newspaper\", a tagline and slogan used by the Tribune since 1909.[13]\n\nThe front page of Part Five of the Chicago Sunday Tribune of April 4, 1948, announcing the launch of WGN-TV the next day.\nWGN-TV began test broadcasts on February 1, 1948,[14] then informally signed on the air on March 6 to broadcast the 1948 Golden Gloves boxing finals from the Chicago Stadium. Regular programming commenced on April 5, 1948, at 7:45\u00a0p.m. with a two-hour-long special, WGN-TV Salute to Chicago.[15] Originating from WGN Radio's studios at the Tribune Tower's Centennial Building annex in the Magnificent Mile district, the inaugural broadcast included dedicatory speeches from McCormick,[c] Chicago Mayor Martin Kennelly, U.S. Senator Charles W. Brooks and Governor Dwight Green. Performances were led by, among others, musician Dick \"Two Ton\" Baker, comedian George Gobel, and bandleader Robert Trendler and the WGN Orchestra (WGN's in-house band). Afterwards, a film previewed WGN-TV's initial program offerings.[16] At the time it signed on, there were only 1,700 operational television sets in Chicago; that number would jump dramatically to around 100,000 sets by April 1949.[17]\nWGN-TV was the second commercial television station in both Chicago and Illinois to sign on, as WBKB (channel 4) launched on September 6, 1946, but had operated on an experimental basis since 1940 as W9XBK. Two other stations joined WBKB and WGN-TV later in 1948: ABC's WENR-TV (channel 7) on September 17 and NBC's WNBQ (channel 5) on October 8. The Tribune quickly followed up WGN-TV's launch with WPIX in New York City on June 15, 1948. Initially, WGN television and radio operated from the Chicago Daily News Building on West Madison and North Canal Streets, occupying space previously used by WMAQ radio from 1929 until relocating to the Merchandise Mart in 1935; WGN-TV also based its 586-foot (179\u00a0m) transmission tower atop the building. Originally broadcasting for 6+1\u20442 hours per day from 2 to 6\u00a0p.m. and from 7:30 to 10\u00a0p.m. seven days a week, Channel 9 started out as an independent station, then began carrying programming from DuMont on September 26, 1948,[18] and also CBS on December 1.[19][20]\nOn January 11, 1949, WGN-TV\u2014along with WNBQ and WENR-TV\u2014began transmitting network programming over a live coaxial feed originating from New York City; this allowed Channel 9 to be able to carry a regular schedule of CBS and DuMont programs that could be transmitted as they aired in the Eastern Time Zone.[21] WBKB-TV assumed primary rights to CBS programming on September 5, 1949; as such, WGN began dropping many CBS shows from its schedule but continued to carry certain network programs that channel 4 declined to broadcast (eventually being reduced strictly to CBS's weekday morning soap opera block by 1952).[22][23] During its tenure with DuMont, WGN-TV became one of that network's strongest affiliates, as well as one of its major production centers. Several DuMont programs were produced from the station's facilities during the late 1940s and the first half of the 1950s, including The Al Morgan Show, Chicago Symphony, Chicagoland Mystery Players, Music From Chicago, The Music Show, They Stand Accused (the first televised courtroom drama program), This is Music, Windy City Jamboree and Down You Go.[24] WGN-TV had also telecast performances of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, beginning in 1953, during Fritz Reiner's tenure as the orchestra's music director.\nOn January 25, 1950, the WGN stations relocated their operations to the Centennial Building. Renovated to accommodate production and office facilities for WGN-TV, the facility included one master (which was situated on inflated rubber bags to eliminate outside noise and vibrations) and two auxiliary studios as well as a sub-basement studio situated 75 feet [23\u00a0m] below street level that could allow WGN-TV-AM and WGNB to continue broadcasts in the event of an atom bomb attack on Chicago.[25][26] As part of United Paramount Theatres (UPT)'s merger with ABC, on February 6, 1953, CBS assumed ownership of WBKB-TV through a $6.75-million acquisition designed to allow UPT[d] to acquire ABC-owned WENR-TV (which subsequently assumed the WBKB call letters and management staff that previously belonged to channel 4), in compliance with FCC regulations that then forbade common ownership of two television stations within the same market. As a consequence of the deal, CBS moved the remainder of its programming to the rechristened WBBM-TV on April 1; this left Channel 9 exclusively affiliated with the faltering DuMont. (WBBM would move from VHF channel 4 to VHF channel 2 on July 5, 1953, in accordance with allocation realignments dictated by the FCC-issued Sixth Report and Order.)[27][28] By 1954, WGN-TV expanded its broadcast schedule to 18 hours per day (running from 6\u00a0a.m. to midnight).\nAfter McCormick succumbed from pneumonia-related complications on April 1, 1955, ownership of WGN-TV-AM, the Chicago Tribune and the News Syndicate Company properties would transfer to the McCormick-Patterson Trust, assigned to the Robert R. McCormick Tribune Foundation in the names of the non-familial heirs of McCormick (whose two marriages never produced any children) and familial heirs of Patterson. (The trust was dissolved in January 1975, with a majority of the trust's former beneficiaries, including descendants of the McCormick and Patterson families, owning stock in the restructured Tribune Company entity\u2014which assumed oversight of all properties previously overseen by the trust\u2014afterward.)[29][30][31][32][33]\n\nIndependence (1956\u20131995)[edit]\nThe station disaffiliated from DuMont when the network ceased operations on August 6, 1956, amid various issues stemming from its relations with Paramount Pictures that hamstrung DuMont from expansion.[34] Because the three remaining commercial broadcast networks (ABC, NBC and CBS) had each owned television stations in Chicago by this time, WGN-TV became an independent station by default. Under executive vice president and general manager Ward L. Quaal (whose stewardship of the station and programming efforts earned him the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences [NATAS]'s Governors' Award in 1966 and 1987), the station adopted a general entertainment format that would become typical of other major market independents up through the early 1990s, carrying a mix of sitcoms and drama series, feature films, cartoons and religious programs as well as locally produced news, public affairs, music and children's programs. WGN-TV also became more reliant on sports programming, led by its broadcasts of Chicago Cubs baseball games as well as other regional collegiate and professional teams. This helped Channel 9 establish itself as a programming alternative to the market's three network-owned stations and as the market's leading independent for much of the next 39 years. After initial struggles due to its carriage of programs that could not accrue viewership sufficient to attract national advertisers, WGN began turning profitable by October 1957. On January 15, 1956, the station moved its transmitter facilities to a 73-foot tall (22\u00a0m) antenna on the roof of the Prudential Building on East Randolph Street and Michigan Avenue, and increased its effective radiated power from 120\u00a0kW to the maximum of 316\u00a0kW.[35][36]\n\nGarfield Goose and Friends was one of the earliest television programs WGN-TV would broadcast in color.\nIn March 1957, WGN began carrying programming from the NTA Film Network; the station served as the programming service's primary Chicago affiliate, offering the majority of NTA's program offerings. (The remaining, limited number of NTA shows not carried by WGN were split between ABC-owned WBKB-TV and NBC-owned WNBQ.) This relationship lasted until National Telefilm Associates discontinued the service in November 1961.[37][38] On November 8, 1957, after conducting internal tests since the fall of 1956, WGN-TV\u2014which had ordered RCA color television equipment in the fall of 1952\u2014began broadcasting select programs in color, consisting primarily of syndicated programs available in the format. In January 1958, WGN became the second Chicago television station (after WNBQ, which began televising programs in the format in January 1954) to begin transmitting local programming in color; along with other color telecasting upgrades to its production and master control facilities, WGN was also the first television station in the world to use equipment (provided by Ampex) capable of videotape recording and playback of color telecasts. The first live program on the station to be broadcast in the format was Ding Dong School, a music-focused children's program hosted by Jackie Van (which WGN picked up in 1957, following its cancellation by WNBQ).[39][40][41] In 1958, WGN-TV earned a Peabody Award\u2014the only local television station to earn the accolade\u2014for its short-lived children's program The Blue Fairy (which was hosted by Brigid Bazlen in the title role, and, along with Garfield Goose and Friends, was one of the first two children's programs produced by the station to be broadcast in color).[42]\nOn June 27, 1961, the operations of WGN-TV and WGN radio were relocated to the WGN Mid-America Broadcast Center (later renamed the WGN Continental Broadcast Center and now simply referred to as WGN Studios), a two-story, 95,000-square-foot (8,826\u00a0m2) complex on West Bradley Place in Chicago's North Center community. The Broadcast Center, which began housing some local program production on January 16 of that year, was developed for color broadcasting\u2014allowing the station to televise live studio shows as well as Chicago Cubs and White Sox baseball games in the format\u2014and with civil defense concerns in mind to provide a safe location to conduct broadcasts in the event of a hostile attack (such as a bombing by a nuclear weapon) targeting downtown Chicago. It houses three main production soundstages as well as two additional soundstages that were originally used as sound recording studios for WGN Radio.[e] The Tribune Company repurposed the former Centennial Building facility for the Chicago American (retitled Chicago Today in 1969), where the newspaper maintained office and publishing operations until it ceased publication in 1974; the space is currently[update] occupied by a Dylan's Candy Bar location.[43][44][45][46][47] An adjacent 20,000-square-foot (1,858\u00a0m2), single-story building that housed certain non-production-related operations for the WGN stations was annexed into the facility (expanding the complex to 14.4 acres [6\u00a0ha]) in 1966.[f]\nIn subsequent years, the Tribune Company gradually expanded its broadcasting unit, of which WGN-TV-AM served as its flagship stations, a tie forged in January 1966, when the subsidiary (sans the WPIX television and radio stations, which continued to be controlled by the Tribune-managed News Syndicate Co. before being fully integrated into the company's main station group following its 1991 sale of the Daily News) was renamed the WGN Continental Broadcasting Company. In 1964, the company started Mid-America Video Tape Productions, which had eventually become WGN Continental Productions (later Tribune Entertainment).[54][55][56] The group became known as the Tribune Broadcasting Company in January 1981, but retained the WGN Continental moniker as its de facto business name until 1984 and as the licensee for WGN-TV and WGN Radio thereafter. The company gained its third television and second radio station in 1960, when it purchased KDAL-TV (now KDLH) and KDAL in Duluth, Minnesota from the estate of the late Dalton LeMasurier (Tribune sold KDAL-TV in 1978 and KDAL radio in 1981); the company would later purchase KCTO (subsequently re-called KWGN-TV) in Denver from J. Elroy McCaw in 1966.[57][58][59] Tribune's later television purchases included those of WANX-TV (subsequently re-called WGNX, now WANF) in Atlanta (in 1983);[60] KTLA in Los Angeles (in 1985);[61] WPHL-TV in Philadelphia (in 1992);[62] WLVI-TV in Boston (owned from 1994 to 2006);[63] KHTV (now KIAH) in Houston (in 1995);[64] KTTY (now KSWB-TV) in San Diego (in 1996);[65] KCPQ and KTWB-TV (now KZJO) in Seattle (in 1998 and 1999, respectively);[66][67] and WBDC-TV (now WDCW) in Washington, D.C. (in 1999).[68] Six other stations\u2014including KDAF in Dallas\u2013Fort Worth and WDZL (now WSFL-TV) in Miami\u2014were added through its purchase of Renaissance Broadcasting in July 1996, and two more were added through its November 1999 acquisition of the Quincy Jones- and Tribune-owned consortium Qwest Broadcasting (forcing the sale of WGNX to the Meredith Corporation in order to acquire Qwest's Atlanta property, WATL).[69][70][71] Finally in December 2013, Tribune purchased Local TV's 19 television stations, giving WGN new sister stations in nearby markets\u2014ABC affiliate WQAD-TV in Davenport, Iowa (serving the Quad Cities region that encompasses parts of northwestern Illinois and southeastern Iowa) and Fox affiliate WITI in Milwaukee\u2014all three of which had pooled their local news reports as part of an existing content and broadcast management agreement formed between Local TV and Tribune in 2008.[g]\nWGN-TV was Chicago's leading independent station during the 1960s and into the 1970s, even as it gained its first four competitors on UHF, one of which would not last more than a year. Locally based Weigel Broadcasting signed on WCIU-TV (channel 26) on February 6, 1964, with a multi-ethnic programming format.[73] On January 4, 1966, New Television Chicago\u2014a joint venture between Field Communications (which, through parent Field Enterprises, was a sister property to the Tribune's main newspaper rivals, the Chicago Sun-Times and the Chicago Daily News, at the time) and local advertising firm Froelich & Friedland\u2014signed on WFLD (channel 32, now a Fox owned-and-operated station), which would grow to become WGN's strongest independent competitor in the area.[74] On May 18, 1969, Aurora-based WLXT-TV (channel 60) signed on with a mix of sporting events and a limited schedule of syndicated programs and local newscasts, operating part-time on weekday evenings and on weekends. (WLXT would cease operations on July 17, 1970.)[75] A fourth competitor arrived on April 5, 1970, when Essaness Television Corporation signed on WSNS-TV (channel 44, now a Telemundo owned-and-operated station).[76] WFLD and WSNS went head to head for supremacy as Chicago's second strongest independent station, and were the only independents in the market besides WGN that were able to turn a reasonable profit; in contrast, WCIU and all of the other competitors that came afterward lagged behind in terms of both ratings and revenue. (WSNS would bow out of the competition in 1982, when, after two years of carrying the over-the-air subscription service only at night on weekdays and for most of the daytime and evening hours on weekends, it converted into a full-time outlet of ONTV.) WGN-TV served as the Chicago affiliate of the United Network for its one month of existence from May to June 1967, when financial issues forced the shuttering of the fledgling network.[77]\nIn May 1969, the station relocated its transmitter facilities to the 1,360-foot (415\u00a0m)-tall west antenna tower of the John Hancock Center on North Michigan Avenue. The original Prudential Building transmitter remained in use as an auxiliary facility until the transmitter dish was disassembled in 1984.[78][79][80] WGN also served as a charter member of the Operation Prime Time syndication service, which was launched in 1976 as a consortium founded by Al Masini and a committee of executives with 18 independent stations (including WGN-TV, which was represented by then-station manager and WGN Continental Broadcasting Vice President Sheldon Cooper) represented by Masini's advertising sales firm TeleRep, offering a mix of miniseries as well as first-run syndicated programs that would be featured on the partner stations (including Solid Gold, Star Search and Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, all of which aired on Channel 9 during the 1980s and early 1990s).[81][82]\nMovies became a more integral part of WGN's schedule during the late 1970s and early 1980s. During this period, depending on whether sports events or specials were scheduled, Channel 9 usually aired four daily features\u2014one in the morning, and two to three films per night\u2014Monday through Friday, and between three and six films per day on Saturdays and Sundays. Among its regular film showcases were WGN [Television] Presents (which aired during the late access slot weeknights from 1948 to 1995, on Saturdays until 1979 and on Sundays until 1997) and Action Theater (a showcase of action and adventure films that ran on midday Sundays from 1952 to 1956 and, later, in Saturday late access from 1979 to 2001). In February 1977, the station also began carrying a nightly prime time feature at 8\u00a0p.m., replacing syndicated dramas that had been airing in the timeslot. (The prime time films were pushed to 7\u00a0p.m. in March 1980, in accordance with the shift of its late-evening newscast into prime time). By January 1980, when WGN became the market's second television station to offer a 24-hour schedule (after WBBM-TV, which adopted such a schedule in 1976), the station began to regularly feature an overnight presentation of older black-and-white and some more recent theatrical and made-for-TV movies at 1\u00a0a.m. (later 3\u00a0a.m. by September 1983), along with a few recent first-run syndicated and older off-network syndicated programs.\n\nExpansion into a national superstation (1978\u20131995)[edit]\nMain article: NewsNation (American TV channel)\nWGN's broadcasts of The Bozo Show and games involving the Chicago Cubs and the Chicago Bulls became very well-known after the station expanded its national footprint via cable.\nWGN-TV began to extend its reach outside of the Chicago area beginning in the mid-1970s, when its signal began to be transmitted via microwave relay to cable television providers in areas of the central Midwestern United States that lacked access to an entertainment-based independent station. By the fall of 1978, the Channel 9 signal was transmitted to 574 cable systems\u2014covering most of Western, Central and Southern Illinois as well as large swaths of Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri and Michigan\u2014reaching an estimated 8.6 million subscribers.[83] On November 9, 1978, Tulsa, Oklahoma-based satellite carrier United Video Inc. uplinked the WGN-TV signal to a Satcom-3 transponder for distribution to cable and C-band satellite subscribers throughout the United States. (United Video uplinked the station's signal without WGN Continental Broadcasting's consent, using a legal exemption in the 1976 Copyright Act's compulsory license statute allowing \"passive\" carriers to retransmit broadcast signals without first seeking the licensee's express permission). This resulted in WGN-TV joining the ranks of Atlanta independent station WTCG (later WTBS and now WPCH-TV) to become America's second national \"superstation\", independent stations distributed via satellite to cable providers within their respective regions, or throughout the country.[84][85]\nWithin a week of attaining national status, WGN-TV added approximately 200 cable systems in various parts of the United States (reaching an estimated one million subscribers) to its total distribution.[86] That cable reach would grow over the next several years: the first heaviest concentrations of availability outside the Midwest developed in the Central U.S. (where WGN's telecasts of Chicago Cubs baseball, Chicago Bulls basketball and The Bozo Show became highly popular) and gradually expanded to encompass most of the nation. Tribune and station management treated WGN-TV as a \"passive\" superstation, asserting a neutral position over United Video relaying its signal to a national audience and leaving United to handle national promotion of the WGN signal, instead of handling those responsibilities directly; this allowed the station to continue paying for syndicated programming and advertising at local rates rather than those comparable to other national networks. (Until Tribune began relaying the Chicago feed to the firm directly in 1985, the company was also not compensated directly by United Video for their retransmission or promotion of WGN's signal; Tribune, however, received royalties from cable systems for programs to which it held the copyright.) As such, WGN-TV became the first Tribune-owned independent station to be distributed to a national pay television audience (United Video would later uplink WPIX in May 1984,[87] Netlink began distributing KWGN-TV in October 1987[88] and Eastern Microwave Inc. began distributing KTLA in February 1988[89]) and the first superstation to be distributed by United Video (with WGN and WPIX being joined by Gaylord Broadcasting-owned KTVT [now a CBS owned-and-operated station] in Dallas\u2013Fort Worth in July 1984[90] and, after it assumed retransmission rights from Eastern Microwave, KTLA in April 1988[91]). For about eleven years afterward, the WGN-TV satellite signal carried the same programming shown within the Chicago market.[92]\nAs it gained national exposure, Channel 9 underestimated WFLD's ability to acquire top-rated, off-network syndicated programs. WFLD's respective owners during this timeframe\u2014Field Communications and Metromedia, the latter of which acquired WFLD in 1982 as part of Field and partner company Kaiser Broadcasting's concurring exits from the television industry\u2014were particularly aggressive in their programming acquisitions as they leveraged their independent stations in other major and mid-sized markets for the strongest programs among those entering into syndication. Channel 32 began strengthening its syndication slate in the fall of 1979, when it acquired the local rights to off-network series such as M*A*S*H, Happy Days and All in the Family, which helped it edge ahead of WGN-TV in the ratings by the end of that year. Not to stay outdone, after Tribune appointed Robert King to replace Sheldon Cooper (who was promoted to president and CEO of the upstart Tribune Entertainment syndication unit) as the station's general manager in 1982, WGN-TV began making its own efforts to acquire stronger first-run and off-network syndicated programs, gaining the rights to series such as Laverne & Shirley, Good Times, Little House on the Prairie and WKRP in Cincinnati. WGN's ratings improved throughout the 1980s under the stewardship of King and his successor, Dennis FitzSimons (who would later elevate to President of Tribune Broadcasting, and later to Executive Vice President and then Chairman/CEO of the Tribune Company before stepping down in 2007), firmly overtaking WFLD to again become the market's top-rated independent by the end of the decade.\nWGN-TV would gain two additional UHF independent competitors over the course of eight months in the early 1980s. On September 18, 1981, Focus Broadcasting signed on Joliet-based WFBN (channel 66, now WGBO-DT), initially running a mix of local public-access programs during the daytime hours and the Spectrum subscription service at night. Then on April 4, 1982, a shared operation over UHF channel 60 launched, involving Metrowest Corporation-owned English-language outlet WPWR-TV (which primarily carried the sports-centered pay service Sportsvision) and HATCO-60-owned Spanish-language outlet WBBS-TV (now UniM\u00e1s owned-and-operated station WXFT-DT). (WBBS took over channel 60 full-time after WPWR moved to channel 50 in January 1987, as a byproduct of Metrowest's 1986 buyout of HATCO-60's share of the license and subsequent sale of the allocation to the Home Shopping Network.)[93][94] WGN and WFLD remained the market's strongest independent stations as they both had more robust programming inventories than their competitors.\n\nFormer logo, used from August 1983 to May 3, 1993.\nIn August 1983, WGN-TV unveiled one of the most successful station image campaigns in the United States with the launch of the \"Chicago's Very Own\" campaign. (The slogan\u2014to which the station holds the trademark rights and continues to be used[update] by WGN\u2014is a variant of the \"Chicago's Own\" tagline that had been used in on-air identifications periodically since the 1960s.) Developed by Peter Marino (WGN-TV's director of promotions at the time) and Mike Waterkotte (then the creative director of now-defunct Chicago advertising agency Eisaman, Johns & Law), the campaign promotions focused on the city's people and cultural heritage as well as WGN-TV's local programming efforts, and were accompanied by an imaging theme performed by legendary R&B singer and Chicago native Lou Rawls. The seven-note musical signature of the image theme was also incorporated into two associated music packages that were used for the station's newscasts and identifications between 1984 and 1993, while the slogan has served as the title for two other news themes commissioned exclusively for WGN-TV in subsequent years (a John Hegner-composed package used from 1993 to 1997 and a 615 Music-composed package that has been used since November 1, 2007) as well as for a weekly profile series that aired from 1988 until 1990 and would evolve into a continuing weekly 9\u00a0p.m. news segment. At various points over the years, the \"[city/region]'s Very Own\" slogan was also adapted by some of its Tribune-owned sister stations (such as WPIX, KTLA and WTTV in Indianapolis).[95][96][97] On November 10, 1984, WGN-TV became an affiliate of the MGM/UA Premiere Network ad hoc syndicated film service.[98][99]\nOn November 22, 1987, during that evening's edition of The Nine O'Clock News, the WGN-TV signal was briefly overridden by video of an unidentified person wearing a Max Headroom mask and sunglasses in front of a sheet of corrugated metal imitating the moving electronic background effect used in the character's TV and movie appearances. However, oscillating audio interference obscured the audio portion throughout the 13-second video excerpt; WGN engineers were able to successfully restore the signal by changing the frequency of its Hancock Center studio transmitter link to override the pirated feed. The extended video, as seen during the roughly 90-second-long hijack occurring later that night during a Doctor Who episode on PBS member station WTTW (channel 11), featured several references to WGN-TV (including the masked person mocking fill-in sports anchor and WGN Radio sports commentator Chuck Swirsky as a \"frickin' nerd\" and a \"frickin' liberal\", and referring to his pretend defecation as a \"masterpiece for all the greatest world newspaper nerds\", paraphrasing the WGN callsign's meaning).[100][101] Bemused, sports anchor Dan Roan\u2014who was presenting highlights of that afternoon's home game between the Chicago Bears and the Detroit Lions (which the Bears won, 30\u201310) when the initial hijack took place at 9:14\u00a0p.m.\u2014commented, \"Well, if you're wondering what happened, so am I,\" and joked that the master control computer \"took off and went wild\". (The perpetrators of the WGN and WTTW intrusions have never been caught or identified.)[102][103][104][105][106]\nOn May 18, 1988, the FCC reinstituted the Syndication Exclusivity Rights Rule (\"SyndEx\"), a rule\u2014previously repealed by the agency in July 1980\u2014that allows television stations to claim local exclusivity over syndicated programs and requires cable systems to either black out or secure an agreement with the claimant station or a syndication distributor to continue carrying a claimed program through an out-of-market station.[107][108][109] To indemnify cable systems from potential blackouts, when the rules went into effect on January 1, 1990, a separate national feed of WGN that featured programs which Tribune and United Video secured for national carriage\u2014consisting of local and some syndicated programs as well as sporting events\u2014except those subjected to league restrictions pertaining to the number of games that could be shown on out-of-market stations annually\u2014that aired on the WGN Chicago signal, and substitute programs not subjected to exclusivity claims\u2014was launched. (The feed was originally structured similarly to the concurrently launched WWOR EMI Service feed of Secaucus, New Jersey-based WWOR-TV, albeit with a larger amount of shared programming. However, the amount of common programming between the WGN local and national feeds would decrease significantly during the 2000s and early 2010s as local exclusivity claims reduced the number of WGN-TV programs that Tribune could clear nationally in later years.)[110] Of the four United Video-distributed superstations, WGN was the only one to increase its national coverage after the SyndEx rules were implemented, adding 2.2 million subscribers by July 1990; some systems also replaced WPIX and WWOR with the WGN superstation feed during the early 1990s.[111][112]\nAmong the various community projects in which the station has been involved include the WGN-TV Children's Charities, a charitable foundation established in 1990 through the Robert R. McCormick Tribune Foundation, benefitting various local organizations that help local children dealing with poverty and medical issues. On January 1, 1993, Tribune launched Chicagoland Television (CLTV), a local cable news channel that features rolling news, weather and sports content and public affairs, sports-talk and entertainment news programs, along with having formerly acted as an overflow feed for WGN's sports telecasts. Originally utilizing its own in-house staff and resources from WGN-TV and the Chicago Tribune, CLTV consolidated its operations with WGN-TV on August 28, 2009, at which time the channel's operations were relocated from its original studio facility in Oak Brook to WGN-TV's Bradley Place studios and editorial control of CLTV was turned over to Channel 9's news department.[113][114][115][116] CLTV's format soon became less reliant on live newscasts, focusing increasingly on repurposed newscasts and local programming from WGN-TV. Following its acquisition of Tribune Media, Nexstar shut down Chicagoland Television on December 31, 2019, after 27 years of operation.[117][118][119]\n\nWB affiliation (1995\u20132006)[edit]\nFormer logo, used from May 3, 1993, to November 10, 2002; as a network affiliate, The WB's logo was placed next to the \"9\" (which is mirrored as the \"G\" in the call sign bar).\nOn November 2, 1993, Time Warner and Tribune (which would acquire an 11 percent interest in the network in August 1995) announced the formation of The WB Television Network. Tribune committed six of the seven independent stations it owned at the time to serve as charter affiliates of The WB, though it initially exempted WGN-TV from the agreement, as station management had expressed concerns about how the network's plans to expand its prime time and daytime program offerings would affect WGN's sports broadcast rights and the impact that the potential of having to phase out its sports telecasts to fulfill network commitments would have on the superstation feed's appeal to cable and satellite providers elsewhere around the United States.[120][121][122][123][124] Ironically, despite its concerns with taking the WB affiliation, WGN had also vied to become the Chicago affiliate of the United Paramount Network (UPN), a joint venture between Chris-Craft/United Television and Paramount Television that announced its launch plans on October 21. On November 10, 1993, Paramount announced it had reached an agreement to affiliate UPN with then-Newsweb Corporation-owned WPWR-TV, which, upon the network's January 16, 1995, launch, would become the largest UPN affiliate not to be owned by either of its parent companies.[125]\nOn December 3, 1993, Tribune reached a separate agreement with Time Warner that would allow WGN-TV to serve as The WB's Chicago affiliate and allow its companion superstation feed to act as a de facto national WB feed until the network was able to fill remaining gaps in affiliate coverage in \"white area\" markets that lacked a standalone independent station following its launch. In exchange, The WB agreed to reduce its initial program offerings to one night per week (from two) in order to limit conflicts with WGN's sports programming. The superstation feed, which reached 37 percent of the country by that time, would extend the network's initial coverage to 73 percent of all U.S. households that had at least one television set. (Prior to that deal, The WB had considered affiliating with WGBO-TV, which Univision would later purchase and convert into an owned-and-operated station of the Spanish-language network on December 30, 1994. United Video intended to provide an alternate feed of WGN with substitute programming for markets with a WB affiliate; however, no such measure was taken, creating network duplication in markets where over-the-air WB affiliates were forced to compete with the WGN cable feed.)[126][127][128][129] WGN-TV (and its superstation feed) became a charter affiliate of The WB when the network launched on January 11, 1995. Upon joining The WB, WGN's programming remained basically unchanged, continuing to feature syndicated programs, feature films, and locally produced shows. As The WB initially offered prime time programs only on Wednesdays at launch, Channel 9 filled the 7 to 9\u00a0p.m. time slot leading into its late-evening newscast with feature films or, from September 1995 until September 1997, programs from the ad-hoc Action Pack syndication block on nights when sports events were not scheduled to air. By the time The WB adopted a six-night-a-week schedule (running Sunday through Fridays) in September 1999, the station had relegated its prime time film presentations to Saturday nights.[130][131]\nChannel 9 chose not to clear the network's Kids' WB block, in favor of airing a local morning newscast and an afternoon sitcom block on weekdays and a mix of news, public affairs and paid programs on Saturday mornings. On February 19, WCIU-TV\u2014which had become an English-language independent full-time as a result of Univision (from which it had aired programming on a part-time basis) moving to WGBO the month prior\u2014reached an agreement with Time Warner to carry the Kids' WB lineup as well as to take on responsibilities of airing WB programs at times when WGN was scheduled to air sporting events during prime time. (Although the network's programming was split between WGN-TV and WCIU locally beginning with the Kids' WB block's September 9, 1995, debut, the WGN superstation feed carried The WB's prime time and children's programs until the stopgap network feed was discontinued.)[132][133][134] Even as Chicago's network-owned stations began adopting network-centric station branding during the mid-to-late 1990s, WGN-TV continued to be referred to on-air as either \"WGN Channel 9\" or simply \"Channel 9\"; by 1999, the station began to be referred to mainly by the WGN call letters (as had been the case with the national feed since 1997). By that time, WGN replaced its late-night feature film presentations (except for the Saturday Action Theater showcase) with syndicated sitcoms.\nDuring the latter half of the 1990s, most of The WB's remaining national coverage gaps began to be filled through standalone affiliations with UPN charter affiliates, leftover independents and former noncommercial stations as well as dual affiliations with various existing network outlets (mainly UPN stations) within the top-100 media markets, and through the September 1998 launch of The WeB (subsequently renamed The WB 100+ Station Group), a packaged feed of WB network and syndicated programs provided to participating cable-based affiliates in the 110 smallest markets. In January 1999, Time Warner and Tribune mutually agreed to stop relaying WB programming over the WGN superstation feed effective that fall; when this move took effect on October 6, the WGN national feed replaced The WB's prime time and children's program lineups, respectively, with movies and syndicated programs.[135][136][137][138][139] By 2002, game shows and additional talk and reality series had been added to the station's schedule, while syndicated animated series were added on weekend mornings. WGN-TV\u2014which continued to carry the network locally\u2014began clearing the entire WB network schedule in September 2004, when it assumed the rights to the Kids' WB lineup from WCIU-TV, effectively becoming the sole remaining station in the Chicago market to run cartoons on weekday afternoons. WGN continued to carry Kids' WB's remaining Saturday morning lineup (which initially aired on a tape-delayed basis on Sunday mornings), after The WB replaced the block's two-hour weekday afternoon slot with the Daytime WB rerun block in January 2006.\n\nCW affiliation; split of the local and national signals (2006\u20132016)[edit]\nOn January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. Entertainment division of Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced the formation of The CW, a network that would initially feature a mix of programs originating on The WB and UPN\u2014which Time Warner and CBS, respectively, would shut down in concurrence with The CW's launch\u2014as well as new series developed specifically for the CW schedule. In conjunction with the launch announcement, Tribune signed a ten-year agreement involving sixteen of the group's 19 WB affiliates (including WGN-TV), which would join eleven UPN stations owned by CBS to form The CW's initial group of charter affiliates.[140][141] Because The CW primarily chose its original affiliates based on the highest overall viewership in each market among the pool of existing WB and UPN affiliates, WGN-TV was chosen as its Chicago affiliate over WPWR-TV, as Channel 9 had been the higher-rated of the two stations dating to WPWR's sign-on. On February 22, Fox announced that WPWR and nine other non-Fox-O&O stations (eight UPN stations, consisting of four in other major markets where The CW chose to align with a Tribune station and four based in non-Tribune markets, and one independent station) would become the initial charter outlets of MyNetworkTV, a joint venture between Fox Television Stations and Twentieth Television meant to fill the two weeknight prime time hours that would be opened up on UPN- and WB-affiliated stations that were not chosen to become CW charter outlets.[142][143] The CW did not commission the WGN national feed\u2014which became known as Superstation WGN in November 2002 and then as WGN America in August 2008\u2014to act as a national default feed for the network, as it was able to maintain sufficient national coverage at launch through conventional over-the-air and digital multicast affiliates in the 100 largest markets as well as supplementary coverage in the remaining 110 markets through The CW Plus, a small-market feed comprising primary and subchannel-only over-the-air affiliates as well as cable-only affiliates that were part of the predecessor WB 100+ service.\n\nFormer logo, used from November 11, 2002, to May 15, 2017; as a network affiliate, the logos of The WB and The CW, respectively, appeared next to the boxed \"9\" (which was originally rendered in blue until 2016).\nChannel 9 remained an affiliate of The WB until the network ceased operations on September 17, 2006; it became a charter affiliate of The CW when that network debuted the following day on September 18. WPWR, meanwhile, had disaffiliated from UPN on September 4 and began carrying MyNetworkTV programming upon that network's September 5 launch. As a CW affiliate, WGN-TV had been one of the network's higher-rated affiliates in terms of overall viewership, often drawing more viewers than Fox-owned WFLD\u2014even in prime time, despite the latter's Fox programming. Channel 9 carried the entire CW schedule from the network's launch, including its children's program blocks (Kids' WB, The CW4Kids/Toonzai, Vortexx and One Magnificent Morning); however, from September 2013 to September 2016, WGN had aired the network's daytime talk show block\u2014which had been reduced to one hour (from two) in September 2011\u2014one hour earlier (at 2\u00a0p.m.) than other CW affiliates in the Central Time Zone, aligning with the block's East Coast airtime. WGN-TV gradually evolved its programming slate during the late 2000s and 2010s, adopting a news-intensive format (expanding its newscast production to 70 hours per week by 2016), and shifting its weekday daytime lineup towards mainly first-run talk and game shows during the daytime hours; as fewer film packages were offered on the syndication market, its weekend schedule also began relying less on feature films and shifted to incorporate local lifestyle and tourism programs as well as additional first-run and off-network syndicated shows.\nOn April 1, 2007, Chicago-based real estate investor Sam Zell announced plans to purchase the Tribune Company in an $8.2-billion leveraged buyout that gave Tribune employees stock and effective ownership of the company. The transaction and concurring privatization of the company was completed upon termination of Tribune stock at the close of trading on December 20, 2007. Prior to the sale's closure, WGN-TV was one of two commercial television stations in the Chicago market, not counting network-owned stations, to have never been involved in an ownership transaction (along with WCIU-TV, which has been owned by Weigel Broadcasting since its February 1964 sign-on).[144][145][146] On December 8, 2008, Tribune filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing a debt load of around $13 billion\u2014making it the largest media bankruptcy in American corporate history\u2014that it accrued from the Zell buyout and related privatization costs as well as a sharp downturn in revenue from newspaper advertising. After a protracted four-year process, on December 31, 2012, Tribune formally exited from bankruptcy under the control of its senior debt holders, Oaktree Capital Management, JPMorgan Chase and Angelo, Gordon & Co.[147][148][149] On July 10, 2013, Tribune announced plans to split off its broadcasting and newspaper interests into two separate companies. WGN-TV and WGN Radio would remain with the original entity, which was renamed Tribune Media and was restructured to focus on the company's broadcasting, digital and real estate properties; the newspaper division\u2014which, in addition to the Chicago Tribune, included publications such as the Los Angeles Times, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel and the Baltimore Sun\u2014was spun off into the standalone entity Tribune Publishing (known as Tronc from June 2016 until the company reverted to its former name in October 2018). The split was completed on August 4, 2014, ending the Tribune's joint ownership with WGN-TV and WGN Radio after 66 and 94 years, respectively. However, WGN-TV continues to maintain a content partnership with the Tribune.[150][151]\nOn December 13, 2014, Tribune converted the WGN America national feed into a conventional cable channel that would focus on acquired and original programs, containing significantly more domestic and internationally acquired programming than the channel did prior to its separation from WGN-TV, and switched from a royalty to a retransmission consent revenue model. As a result, WGN America immediately ceased simulcasts of WGN-TV's Chicago-originated local programming (which was limited to its weekday noon and [until that simulcast was dropped the previous February] nightly 9\u00a0p.m. newscasts, select news specials, public affairs programs, special events and sports telecasts, alongside a limited number of off-network syndicated reruns, religious programs and feature films acquired for the Chicago feed). Starting with its addition to Comcast Xfinity's Chicago-area systems on December 16, the changeover allowed cable and IPTV subscribers within the market\u2014as local satellite viewers had been able to do for about two decades\u2014to receive WGN America for the first time. (As a result of the October 2007 separation of TBS from its Atlanta parent WTBS, WGN America had been the last remaining national superstation to be distributed to cable, IPTV, fiber optic and satellite television providers, whereas the other six remaining superstations are distributed outside their home regions mainly on satellite.)[152][153][154] Due to the separation of the local and national feeds, WGN-TV did not carry WGN America's original drama series (such as Salem and Manhattan) outside of preview promotions, limiting the local availability of these programs to subscribers of DirecTV and Dish Network and through WGN America's streaming agreement with Hulu.[155] WGN-TV would regain national availability in the spring of 2015, when Channel Master included the Chicago feed among the initial offerings of its LinearTV over-the-top streaming service.[156]\n\nReturn to independence (2016\u2013present)[edit]\nOn May 23, 2016, after a year of protracted negotiations pertaining to financial terms (including the share of reverse compensation that Tribune would pay to keep CW programming on those stations), Tribune Broadcasting and CW managing partner CBS Corporation reached a five-year agreement that allowed twelve of Tribune's thirteen CW-affiliated stations to remain with the network through 2021. Tribune exempted WGN-TV from the renewed agreement, intending to free up its schedule to offer an increased schedule of Chicago Cubs, White Sox, Bulls and Blackhawks games in prime time during the calendar year, thereby giving WGN over-the-air exclusivity over all sporting events it is contracted to broadcast for the first time since 1993.[157][158][159][160][161] The WB and The CW each contractually limited the number of network program preemptions, other than those caused by long-form breaking news coverage, that could occur on an annual basis; in compliance with these restrictions, WGN-TV purchased airtime on CLTV (from 1993 to 2002), WCIU-TV (from 1999 to 2015) and WPWR-TV (from 2015 to 2016) to carry certain game telecasts that the station was contracted to produce (totaling roughly 30 per year). WB and CW network programs subjected to sports-induced displacements on their regular nights were shown on a tape-delayed basis later in the week (usually in a graveyard slot or on a weekend evening timeslot not occupied by a scheduled game telecast, as neither The WB nor The CW has ever aired prime time programs on Saturdays and as The CW had embargoed providing programs on Sundays from September 2009 until October 2018).[162][163][164][165]\nConcurrently, Fox announced that WPWR would take over as Chicago's CW affiliate (marking the second time that Fox Television Stations had owned a CW-affiliated station, as, under an existing contract that was already scheduled to expire before that station's conversion into a Fox O&O was announced, Charlotte sister station WJZY continued to carry the network's programming for about 3\u00bd months after its purchase by Fox was finalized in April 2013).[166][163] The final CW program to air on WGN-TV was Whose Line Is It Anyway? at 8:30\u00a0p.m. Central Time on August 31, 2016, leading into that night's edition of WGN News at Nine. Channel 9 reverted to independent status\u2014marking the first time in 21 years that it was not affiliated with a major broadcast network\u2014on September 1, filling timeslots previously occupied by CW network shows mainly with additional syndicated programs on weekdays and an expanded weekend morning newscast, station-produced lifestyle programs and syndicated educational programs on weekends. Beginning with that day's airing of The Bill Cunningham Show, all CW programming concurrently moved to WPWR-TV (resulting in the weeknight-only MyNetworkTV schedule being shifted to air on a three-hour delay from 10\u00a0p.m. to midnight). As such, WPWR displaced WLVI in Boston as the largest CW station that is not owned by either Tribune or CBS Corporation. (The CW would eventually move to WCIU-TV on September 1, 2019, marking the first time that channel 26\u2014which had maintained part-time affiliations with the Spanish International Network and successor Univision, NetSpan/Telemundo, and The WB [by way of Kids' WB] at various points between 1968 and 2004\u2014had ever served as a full-time network affiliate.)[167][168]\n\nAborted sale to Sinclair Broadcast Group; sale to Nexstar Media Group[edit]\nMain article: Attempted acquisition of Tribune Media by Sinclair Broadcast Group\nSinclair Broadcast Group announced their purchase of Tribune Media on May 8, 2017, for $3.9 billion,[169][170] a deal publicly met with consternation among station employees due to concerns about the influence the conservative-leaning group could potentially have on WGN's news content.[171][172] In order to meet regulatory compliance, Sinclair opted to divest WGN-TV to a limited liability company controlled by Baltimore-based automotive dealer Steven Fader\u2014who has acted as a business associate to Sinclair executive chairman David Smith\u2014for $60 million.[173] Under the terms of the deal, Sinclair planned to operating the station through programming and sales service agreements, and would hold an option to repurchase with eight years.[174] Following public criticism of the proposed deal with Fader by FCC chairman Ajit Pai,[175][176] Sinclair abandoned the deal and disclosed it would instead acquire WGN-TV directly.[177] Despite this, the FCC instead voted to bring the merger up for a hearing by an administrative law judge,[178] prompting Tribune Media to terminate the deal on August 9, 2018, and file a breach of contract lawsuit.[179][180]\nFollowing the collapse of the Sinclair merger, Nexstar Media Group agreed to acquire Tribune's assets on December 3, 2018, for $6.4 billion in cash and debt.[181] The transaction received approval by the FCC on September 16, 2019,[182][183] and finalized three days later.[184][185][186]\n\nProgramming[edit]\nLocally produced programs[edit]\nWGN-TV currently produces the following programs, some of which were previously rebroadcast on CLTV:\n\nAdelante, Chicago (English: Onward, Chicago) is a bi-weekly public affairs program (airing Saturdays every two weeks at 6:30\u00a0a.m.) that debuted on February 19, 2000, and was originally hosted by former WGN-TV assignment reporter Eddie Arruza.[187] Currently hosted by Lourdes Duarte (who also co-anchors the 4\u00a0p.m. hour of the WGN Evening News), it features topical discussions, interviews and feature segments focusing on Chicago's Hispanic community and culture.\nBackStory with Larry Potash is a half-hour historical series that premiered on October 18, 2018. Hosted by WGN Morning News anchor/assignment reporter Larry Potash and airing Saturdays at 10:30\u00a0p.m., the program looks at interesting stories pertaining to history, culture, religion and science within and outside of Chicago.[188][189]\nLiving Healthy Chicago is a weekly health-focused program (airing Saturdays at 10\u00a0a.m.) that premiered in September 2011. Hosted by Jane Monzures, it features expert medical advice and health tips from local health professionals.\nPeople to People is a bi-weekly public affairs program (airing most Saturdays at 6:30\u00a0a.m.) that debuted in 1973, with local civil rights leader Edwin C. \"Bill\" Berry as its original host.[190] Currently hosted by Micah Materre (who also serves as weeknight co-anchor of the WGN Evening News and the 9 and 10\u00a0p.m. newscasts), the program community events and topical discussions focusing on the African-American community.\nWGN-TV Political Report, which airs Sundays at 9\u00a0a.m. and premiered on January 12, 2020, is a weekly political talk show in which hosts Paul Lisnek (who serves as WGN-TV's political analyst and hosted a similar daily evening program, Politics Tonight, from 2007 until CLTV's closure in December 2019) and Tahman Bradley (who serves as the station's weekend evening anchor and political reporter) provide analysis on Chicago-area and national political issues.[191]\nChannel 9 became known for its heavy schedule of local programs during the period from the 1950s through the 1980s, including some influential programs:\n\nThe Bozo Show, a long-running children's program that aired under various titles and formats\u2014including as Bozo (1960\u20131961), Bozo's Circus (1961\u20131980) and The Bozo Super Sunday Show (1994\u20132001) as well as the short-lived prime time spin-off Big Top (1965\u20131967)\u2014from June 20, 1960, until July 14, 2001. The program was WGN-TV's most successful local program in terms of both ratings and cultural impact, and became the most well-known iteration of the Bozo franchise partly as a result of the exposure it received after WGN became a national superstation in 1978. Bozo originated as a live, half-hour midday broadcast (expanding to a full hour in September 1961) featuring comedy sketches, circus acts, cartoon shorts and in-studio games.[192][193][194] The titular clown was portrayed by Bob Bell until 1984 and by Joey D'Auria thereafter, and featured additional characters such as Ringmaster Ned (Ned Locke, 1961\u20131976), Sandy the Tramp (Don Sandburg, 1961\u20131969), Oliver O. Oliver (Ray Rayner, 1961\u20131971), Cooky the Cook (Roy Brown, 1968\u20131994), Wizzo the Wizard (Marshall Brodien, 1968\u20131994) and the circus manager (Frazier Thomas, 1976\u20131985). At the peak of its popularity, ticket reservations for the show's studio audience surpassed a ten-year backlog. (WGN-TV management would discontinue the wait list in 1990, and began awarding tickets through a contest-style giveaway.) In response to Chicago Public Schools rule changes that disallowed students from going home for lunch, the program was moved to weekday mornings and switched to a pre-taped format in August 1980; to accommodate the launch of the WGN Morning News, Bozo was relegated to Sunday mornings in September 1994, remaining there until it was controversially discontinued by station management in 2001. For the final four years of its run, The Bozo Super Sunday Show was restructured to incorporate segments compliant with FCC educational programming requirements.[195][196][197]\nCharlando (transl. Chatting), a Spanish-language talk show focusing on Chicago's Hispanic and Latino community (originally airing on Saturday mornings until 1992, when it was moved to Sundays) that aired from 1964 to 1999. Peter Nuno hosted the program for its entire 35-year run before retiring from WGN-TV in December 1999.[198][199][200]\nCreature Features, a local version of the horror film franchise which aired Saturday nights from September 19, 1970, until May 19, 1976, showcasing classic horror and science fiction films released between the 1930s and the 1950s (many of which were Universal Studios releases). The films were presented by a disembodied voice known only as \"The Creature\" (voiced, at respective times, by WGN news anchors Carl Greyson and Marty McNeeley). After the WGN version ended, the title (unpluralized as \"Creature Feature\") was used by WFLD for its weekend horror movie presentations until their replacement by the Son of Svengoolie showcase in 1979.\nFamily Classics, a showcase of family-oriented feature films that originally ran from September 14, 1962, to December 25, 2000 and was co-created by Frazier Thomas and Fred Silverman (then a programming executive at WGN-TV).[201] As host, Thomas also was responsible for selecting the program's featured film titles and edited them to remove certain scenes he deemed unfit for family viewing; Roy Leonard took over hosting duties following Thomas's death in April 1985 from complications tied to a stroke, and remained in that role until Family Classics ended its initial run. (After airing weekly throughout the fall-to-spring television season\u2014first on Friday nights until 1986, and then on Sunday afternoons thereafter\u2014for most of its run, the program began airing sporadically during the holiday season from November 1993 until the conclusion of the program's original run.) Family Classics was revived as an occasional series on December 8, 2017, with longtime entertainment reporter Dean Richards as host.[202]\nGarfield Goose and Friends, a children's program that aired on WGN-TV from September 1955 to October 1976 (originating on WBKB/WBBM-TV and then WBKB/WLS-TV under the unpluralized title Garfield Goose and Friend from 1952 to 1955). Considered the longest-running puppet show on television, the series was hosted by Frazier Thomas as the \"prime minister\" to the titular clacking goose puppet (puppeteered by Roy Brown) who designated himself as \"King of the United States\". The WGN-TV run of the program featured a mix of puppet characters developed by Brown before and after the show's move to Channel 9 such as Romberg Rabbit, Macintosh Mouse, Christmas \"Chris\" Goose (Garfield's nephew) and sleepy bloodhound Beauregard Burnside III (a character named after two Civil War generals). In addition to skits, the show also featured animated shorts (such as Clutch Cargo and Space Angel) that were introduced by the camera zooming into the \"Little Theater Screen\", as well as educational feature segments.[203]\nIssues Unlimited, a Sunday morning public affairs program moderated by Chicago Bulletin editor and columnist Hurley Green Sr. from 1971 to 1987; the program featured a panel of local media representatives interviewing local and national newsmakers.[204]\nRay Rayner and His Friends (originally Breakfast with Bugs Bunny from 1962 to 1964), a long-running children's program hosted by Ray Rayner from 1962 to 1980. The program featured animated shorts (including Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons), arts and crafts segments, animals (such as Chelveston the Duck, named after the military base where Rayner was stationed during World War II), science segments conducted with J. Bruce Mitchell of the Museum of Science and Industry and a viewer mail segment in which Rayner appeared alongside a talking orange dog puppet, Cuddly Dudley (voiced by Roy Brown), which was originally created by the Chicago Tribune as a promotional item.[205][206]\nIn addition, Channel 9 broadcasts several local events including the Chicago Thanksgiving Parade (which has aired since 2007, under an agreement with the Chicago Festival Association in which the WGN national feed\u2014which continues to carry the parade despite WGN America's December 2014 programming separation from WGN-TV\u2014was given national simulcast rights),[207] the Chicago St. Patrick's Day Parade (which aired from 1949 to 2002), the Chicago Auto Show (from 1952 to 1992 and again since 1999)[208][209] and the Philadelphia-based Mummers Parade (by arrangement with sister station WPHL-TV). Local events that WGN-TV aired in previous years have included the Bud Billiken Parade (from 1978 to 2011, with WCIU-TV obtaining primary rights to the broadcast beginning in 2012, before shifting exclusively to WLS-TV\u2014which had been a partial rightsholder for the parade since 1984\u2014in 2014).[210][211]\nThe station's Bradley Place studios, in addition to housing a large number of its own programs, have also served as the production facilities for nationally syndicated programs, including Donahue (which shifted production from the Dayton, Ohio studios of WLWD [now WDTN] to the WGN-TV facilities in Chicago in 1974, where production of the daytime talk show remained before moving to WBBM-TV's Streeterville studios in January 1982),[212] U.S. Farm Report (which originated from the Bradley Place facility from the agriculture program's national syndication debut in 1975 until production moved to South Bend, Indiana after Farm Journal's production unit assumed distribution rights from the defunct Tribune Entertainment in 2008), and At the Movies (which was produced from the facility from 1982 until 1990, three years after Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert left the program amid a 1986 contract dispute with Tribune Entertainment to develop Siskel & Ebert & the Movies with Buena Vista Television, which was produced out of WBBM-TV's studios and later WLS-TV's North State Street studios).\nChannel 9 formerly served as the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA)'s \"Love Network\" station for Chicago, carrying the charity's annual telethon on Labor Day and the preceding Sunday night each September from 1973 to 2012 (in its original 21\u00bd-hour format that existed until 2010, the six-hour evening format used in 2011 and the three-hour prime-time-only format used in 2012). For most of its run on the station (except in 1994, due to the Major League Baseball strike that year), WGN-TV would preempt portions of the telethon on Labor Day to carry Chicago Cubs or White Sox games held during the afternoon of the holiday. Through its national distribution, beginning with the 1979 event, donations to the WGN-produced local segments of the telethon were also pledged by viewers in other parts of the United States and Canada. The broadcast moved from syndication to ABC in September 2013 (by then reduced to a two-hour special), airing thereafter by association on WLS-TV until the final telecast of the retitled MDA Show of Strength in August 2014.[213]\n\nLottery[edit]\nWGN-TV served as the originating station for the Illinois Lottery beginning at its July 1974 inception. Live drawings initially aired as a half-hour Thursday night broadcast (then hosted by Ray Rayner) held at its Bradley Place studios. Channel 9 shared the drawing rights with WSNS-TV from March to May 1975 and again from September 1975 until August 1977, when WGN gained exclusivity over the telecasts. With the introduction of the Daily Game (now Pick 3) in February 1980, drawings began airing on the station at 6:57\u00a0p.m. nightly.[214] After a three-year run on WFLD (which assumed drawing rights in January 1984), the Lottery migrated the drawing telecasts back to WGN-TV in January 1987. In August 1992, the Lottery awarded the telecast rights to its drawings and game show to CBS-owned WBBM\u2014which beat out competing offers from WGN and WLS-TV, and saw the move as a way to help improve viewership for its third-place-ranked 10\u00a0p.m. newscast\u2014effective December 28. WBBM's bid was chosen for its offers to hold the drawings during its late newscast (which ultimately produced no beneficial ratings impact) and agreed to handle promotional responsibilities and production costs.[208] Citing in part the station's statewide cable distribution (which, after the SyndEx rules were implemented, would occasionally subject the evening drawings to preemption associated with that of the delayed 9\u00a0p.m. newscast when sports clearance restrictions applied to the WGN national feed), the Lottery moved its telecasts back to WGN on January 1, 1994; with this move, citing declining revenues under the WBBM contract partly under the later drawing timeslot, the live evening results were shifted to 9:22\u00a0p.m. Midday drawings for Pick 3 and Pick 4 were added upon their introduction on December 20, 1994. (The 12:40\u00a0p.m. drawings were shown during WGN's noon newscast on weekdays, while the Saturday drawing was usually not shown live nationally because of programming substitutions.)[215][216][217][218]\nIn addition to the live drawing results, WGN also carried two lottery-produced weekly game shows. From September 16, 1989, to December 19, 1992, and from January 8 to July 2, 1994, the station aired $100,000 Fortune Hunt. It was originally hosted by Jeff Coopwood, with co-host Linda Kollmeyer, and subsequently with Mike Jackson as host. The program saw six contestants selected from a preliminary scratch-off entry ticket drawing choose panels from a numbered 36-panel game board containing various dollar amounts. The player with the highest prize amount after five rounds won $100,000 and their two chosen at-home partners won $500 each; the remaining on-air contestants kept their existing winnings, with their partners receiving $100. (Initially, each on-air contestant was given the option of keeping their winnings or trading them for other prizes.) [219][217][220] Its successor, Illinois Instant Riches (retitled Illinois' Luckiest in 1998), ran from July 9, 1994, to October 21, 2000, with Mark Goodman and Kollmeyer as co-hosts. Produced in conjunction with Mark Goodson Productions (later Jonathan Goodson Productions), it featured a similar drawing format as its predecessor, but had individual contestants chosen randomly by a wheel spun by Kollmeyer each round (which was hooked to lights above each contestant's seat) play various mini-games.[221]\nIn September 1996, the station began carrying The Big Game multi-state drawing (replaced by Mega Millions in May 2002) each Tuesday and Friday; Powerball drawings were eventually added upon Illinois joining that multi-state lottery in January 2010. WGN America ceased carrying the drawings nationally on December 12, 2014; the Lottery ceased televising its daily drawings outright and moved the results for the Pick 3, Pick 4, Lotto with Extra Shot and Lucky Day Lotto (formerly Little Lotto until 2011) games exclusively to its website on October 1, 2015, upon switching to a random number generator structure.[222][223][224][225]\n\nSports programming[edit]\nMain article: WGN Sports\nThroughout its history, WGN-TV has had a long association with Chicago sports, with most of the city's major professional sports franchises\u2014particularly the Chicago Cubs, White Sox, Bulls and Blackhawks\u2014and several local and regional collegiate teams (including the Illinois Fighting Illini, the Northwestern Wildcats, the DePaul Blue Demons and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish as well as various Big Ten Conference universities) having regularly televised their games over channel 9.\nThe Cubs and White Sox were the first teams to be carried on the station, when on April 23, 1948, WGN aired a crosstown rivalry game that the Sox won, 4\u20131. (The Tribune Company wholly owned the Cubs from 1981 until 2008, and retained a minority interest in the team until January 2019.)[226][227][228] Over the years, the number of Cubs and White Sox games on WGN had gradually decreased (down to about 70 per season for each team by 2008) as a result of the two Major League Baseball clubs\u2014as well as the NBA's Bulls\u2014migrating some of their local game telecasts to cable-originated regional sports networks, Fox Sports Net Chicago (later FSN Chicago) from 1999 until 2003 and then Comcast SportsNet Chicago (now NBC Sports Chicago) beginning in 2004. Beginning in 2015, WGN-TV began sharing the over-the-air rights to Cubs games with WLS-TV, resulting in Channel 9 reducing its coverage schedule to 45 games per season as part of a four-year contract involving the two stations.[229][230] WGN carried the White Sox until 1972, before returning to the station for one season in 1981; the White Sox moved its local telecasts to WGN-TV after an eight-year absence in 1990.[231][232][233]\nThe Bulls began carrying their games with its inaugural season in 1966; after airing their games on WFLD for four years, the Bulls returned to WGN-TV for the 1989\u201390 season, overlapping with the start of the team's NBA championship dynasty during Michael Jordan's tenure with the team.[234][232] WGN initially carried Blackhawks NHL games (which, per prohibitions on televised home games imposed by then-owner Bill Wirtz in order to sustain ticket sales, were restricted to away games) from 1961 until 1975. The Blackhawks returned to the station during the 2008\u201309 season, with a package of both home and away games (the result of Rocky Wirtz's decision to end the home game television blackout after taking over the franchise's ownership following his father's death).[235][236] WGN-TV carried Chicago Bears regular season football games as a DuMont affiliate during the 1951 NFL season, after which the team moved their telecasts to ABC (and by association, ABC O&O WBKB-TV [now WLS-TV]) under a limited contract; the Bears aired their first game on WGN in 55 years on October 1, 2012, when the station carried the team's Monday Night Football matchup against the Dallas Cowboys. (NFL rules require national games aired by cable networks to be syndicated to broadcast stations in the participating teams' home markets.) Although WLS-TV has right of first refusal to MNF due to its corporate parent The Walt Disney Company's majority ownership of ESPN, WLS passed on carrying the game in order to air that night's live broadcast of ABC's Dancing with the Stars.[237]\nFrom November 1978 until October 2014, WGN America frequently simulcast WGN Sports broadcasts (mostly Cubs, White Sox and Bulls games) nationwide, when permitted under the station's sports contracts. (Tribune's President and CEO at the time, Peter Liguori, cited the limited viewership and advertising revenue generated from televising sports on a national basis relative to their contractual expense for its decision to stop carrying WGN's sports telecasts over WGN America after the 2014 MLB season.)[238] In addition, until it ceased offering sporting events in September 2019, WGN-TV also distributed its White Sox and Bulls telecasts to television stations in Illinois, Indiana and Iowa that are within their respective broadcast territories (including CW affiliate WISH-TV in Indianapolis and the subchannels of WGN sister stations WHO-DT in Des Moines and WQAD in Davenport, Iowa).[239][240][241] WGN-TV's Cubs and White Sox game broadcasts also were often carried on the MLB Extra Innings feeds available to DirecTV subscribers, sometimes including local commercials and station promotions that were not shown during the WGN America telecasts from the imposition of the SyndEx rules until the 2014 separation of the national and local feeds. (This also was the case for WGN-produced games shown on WPWR-TV, as well as WLS-TV's Cubs broadcasts.)\nOn January 2, 2019, the White Sox, Bulls and Blackhawks agreed to an exclusive multi-year deal with NBC Sports Chicago to take effect that fall. This was followed on February 13 by the announcement of the formation of the Marquee Sports Network, a joint venture between the Cubs and Sinclair Broadcast Group that launched in the spring of 2020.[242][243][244][245] As a consequence of the four teams electing to move their local game telecasts off broadcast television completely in favor of airing them exclusively over regional sports networks, WGN wound down its local sports coverage throughout the spring and summer of 2019\u2014beginning with the April 1 game between the Blackhawks and the Winnipeg Jets,[246] and continuing with its final game telecasts involving the Bulls (an away game against the New York Knicks on April 9)[247] and the Cubs (an away game against the rival St. Louis Cardinals on September 27)[248][249]\u2014as the station's contracts with all four teams gradually expired.[250] WGN-TV's final sports telecast involving any of the station's four legacy professional sports broadcast partners was the second game of a White Sox\u2013Detroit Tigers doubleheader at Guaranteed Rate Field on September 28, 2019.[251] However, on February 19, 2020, Chicago Fire FC announced a multi-year agreement with WGN-TV to broadcast their Major League Soccer (MLS) telecasts on the station, beginning with its March 7 match against the New England Revolution, returning regular sporting events to Channel 9 after a seven-month hiatus.[252][253][254] Those games moved to MLS Season Pass beginning in 2023, and without any NFL-style syndication rights, the 2022 season was the final season for Fire broadcasts on any television channel.[255] The deal also marks the first time in the station's 74-year history that Channel 9 will not have any local sports programming on the station.\nWGN returned to The CW in small manner in 2023, when it began to broadcast weekend coverage from the now Nexstar-owned network of the controversial LIV Golf league in place of WCIU, which refused to carry it due to already-existing weekend programming commitments.[256] WGN will also air Atlantic Coast Conference football and men's basketball games instead of WCIU.[citation needed]\n\nNews operation[edit]\nAs of January 2020[update], WGN-TV presently broadcasts 72\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 12\u00bd hours each weekday, 5\u00bd hours on Saturdays and 4\u00bd hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest newscast output of any television station in the Chicago market and the state of Illinois, and the sixth-highest newscast output in the United States behind WAGA-TV in Atlanta, WHDH in Boston, KTVK in Phoenix, WISH-TV in Indianapolis, and WGN-TV's sister station KTLA in Los Angeles. In addition to its conventional local newscasts, the station produces two late-evening sports news programs: 'GN Sports, a half-hour sports highlight and interview program (airing nightly at 10:30\u00a0p.m.), which is co-anchored by longtime sports director Dan Roan (who joined WGN as a weekend sports anchor and sports reporter in 1984) and Jarrett Payton (son of late Chicago Bears Hall of Famer Walter Payton, and brother of former Chicago's Best host and current WFLD anchor Brittney Payton, who joined the station in 2015 as the 4\u00a0p.m. sports anchor for the WGN Evening News);[257] and Instant Replay, a 20-minute Sunday evening highlight program (airing during the final 20 minutes of the 9\u00a0p.m. newscast), which is solo anchored by Roan.\nUntil regular sports telecasts on WGN-TV ended in September 2019, the station's midday, early and late evening newscasts were subject to (at least, partial) preemption or delay due to local sports telecasts overrunning into that time period; from July 8, 2010, onward, CLTV had served as an alternate broadcaster of WGN-TV newscasts that were preempted by the latter's sports broadcasts and aired live half-hour editions of WGN News at Nine on nights when Channel 9 carried a sports event being held on the West Coast that started locally at 9\u00a0p.m. (An additional half-hour live newscast followed the game telecast on WGN-TV, which had originally been titled under the WGN News at Nine brand prior to the 2016 launch of its 10\u00a0p.m. newscast.)[258] The WGN-TV weather staff also provides local weather updates for WGN Radio under an agreement that began on October 13, 2008, at the conclusion of The Weather Channel's ten-year content partnership with the radio station.[259]\n\nNews department history[edit]\nNews van outside the Dirksen Federal Building in June 2018.\nAlthough sports has been a major part of WGN-TV's identity, the station has also been well known in the Chicago area for its news programming, which, through its former co-ownership with the Chicago Tribune, has played an important role since its launch. WGN's news department\u2014which shared operations and management with WGN Radio until the news division was split into separate departments maintained by the respective properties in 1983\u2014began operations along with the station on April 5, 1948, with the launch of its first regular news program, the Chicagoland Newsreel, which was the first television newscast in the Chicago market to consist entirely of filmed coverage. The 15-minute broadcast\u2014which originally aired weeknights at 6:45\u00a0p.m., with a midday edition at 11:30\u00a0a.m. being added in September 1949\u2014was anchored by news director Spencer Allen (who had been a reporter and news writer for WGN Radio since 1938) and used a large staff of photographers and technicians, many of whom had previously worked for the Tribune; Allen also anchored a 15-minute midday news program for Channel 9, Spencer Allen and the News, from 1951 to 1953.[260]\nFrom 1948 to 1965, WGN also produced an additional 15-minute-long newscast at 6:30\u00a0p.m., with Austin Kiplinger (to be replaced by Allen in 1953 and then by Lloyd Pettit in 1956) reading the news summary and Frann Weigel as the weather anchor; the program was expanded to a half-hour in September 1955, when Newsreel was discontinued in favor of an amended sports news segment (anchored originally by Vince Lloyd). Under Allen's leadership, WGN-TV's newscasts evolved from a \"police blotter/fire alarm-type of news operation\" to incorporating more in-depth and investigative reports. WGN-TV also was the first Chicago television station to televise a local appearance by a U.S. President (carrying Harry S. Truman's 1948 visit to Chicago) and provided mobile coverage of Gen. Douglas MacArthur's visit to the city (in April 1951); it has also provided coverage of the Republican and Democratic presidential conventions each election cycle since 1952, and provided extensive pool coverage of Pope John Paul II's Mass at Grant Park in 1979.\nIn September 1951, Channel 9 began carrying a 15-minute late night edition of Chicagoland Newsreel that followed its late evening movie presentations (which began at 10\u00a0p.m. at the time). By 1967, the program had evolved into Night Beat, a 30-minute overnight newscast that\u2014until it was discontinued in 1983\u2014featured the main anchor (which had included, among others, Greyson, McNeeley, Cliff Mercer and Jack Taylor) presenting a summary of local and world news headlines as well as a brief weather forecast summary. In February 1955, the station installed a coaxial cable link from the city room of the Chicago Tribune (originally done for the early newscast, First Edition, which aired from 1954 to 1956) to allow Tribune reporters and contributors to provide information on developing stories being covered by the newspaper and the WGN news department.[261] After WGN-TV became an independent station in August 1956, the evening newscast was moved to 7\u00a0p.m.\u2014becoming the market's first prime time newscast and often being subjected to sports-induced preemptions\u2014before settling at 10\u00a0p.m. in September 1959, originally under the title 10th Hour News (known in later years as The Park-Ruddle News and [Jack Taylor/John Drury and] NewsNine). In May 1960, the late newscast (which, by that point, was anchored by Jim Conway, who also hosted a self-titled daytime talk show at the time) became the first local television news program in the U.S. to expand to a half-hour broadcast. Standard news updates presented by various on-staff anchors\u2014under the title WGN Newsbreak\u2014also ran during the late morning, early afternoon and prime time hours in-between programs.[262]\nIn 1965, WGN appointed the first dual-anchor team ever employed in Chicago television news, as Gary Park (who came to the station from KCRA-TV in Sacramento) and Jim Ruddle (who previously worked at WTVT in Tampa) took the helm of the evening newscasts. On January 9, 1967, WGN shifted the 10 p.m. edition of the newscast by 15 minutes (concurrently reducing it to that length) in an attempt to improve viewership by placing the telephone quiz show The Name Game in the timeslot, reducing competition with late newscasts on WLS-TV, WMAQ-TV and WBBM-TV. (This experiment ended in May 1967, when WGN reverted to carrying the late newscast in its former 10\u00a0p.m. slot and expanded it to 25 minutes.) The Park-Ruddle combination was broken up in June 1967, when Ruddle left to join NBC-owned WMAQ-TV, to be followed two years later by Park taking a prime time anchor role at fellow independent KTVU (now a Fox owned-and-operated station) in San Francisco.[263][264][265] Also in 1965, WGN premiered its first attempt at a morning news show with Top 'o' the Morning; Orion Samuelson\u2014then a farm reporter for WGN Radio, who would eventually host the syndicated U.S. Farm Report starting in 1975\u2014and Harold Turner (later replaced by Max Armstrong) provided agricultural news and weather. The program was replaced in May 1984 by a traditional morning newscast, Chicago's First Report, which was canceled due to low viewership that December.\nThe WGN news department has long been one of the most respected local television news operations in the United States and has earned several journalism awards throughout its history, including Emmy, Associated Press, United Press International and duPont-Columbia Awards. The station has also long established top-drawer talent for its newscasts, many of whom have worked at WGN-TV for more than ten years, including Jack Taylor (anchor/reporter, 1954\u20131984, whose run included a stint as primary weeknight anchor from 1970 to 1979),[266] Carl Greyson (anchor, reporter and staff announcer, 1955\u20131980),[267] Marty McNeeley (anchor/reporter, 1969\u20131986),[268] Robert Jordan (anchor/reporter, 1973\u20131978 and 1980\u20132016), Muriel Clair (assignment reporter, 1978\u2013present, part-time since December 2011),[269] and Steve Sanders (anchor/reporter, 1982\u20132020).[270] John Drury joined WGN-TV in 1967 for what would be a three-year stint as anchor of its 10\u00a0p.m. news as well as occasionally serving as anchor of Night Beat. After working for WLS-TV for nine years, Drury returned to his former role at WGN in 1979, displacing Jack Taylor as 10\u00a0p.m. NewsNine anchor. During his second stint at WGN, Drury took on an expanded role doing assignment and investigative reporting (often producing the reports with investigative reporter Alex Burkholder). In 1982, then-Mayor Jane Byrne, accompanied by members of her public relations and cabinet staff, tried to talk Drury into shelving a report on Byrne's use of public funds towards city festivals designed to promote her administration in relation to her stint residing in the Cabrini-Green housing project. Drury went forward with the investigative report, which aided in Byrne's loss to Harold Washington in the 1983 Democratic mayoral primary and would help earn Drury a Chicago Emmy Award for Individual Excellence (the first of four Emmys during his career).[271][272]\nAnother mainstay of WGN-TV has been Tom Skilling, who joined WGN in August 1978 to succeed Harry Volkman (who had two stints at the station, first from 1967 until 1970 and again from 1974 until the summer of 1978) as the station's main evening meteorologist. Skilling\u2014who is rumored to be the highest paid local television meteorologist in the United States\u2014would become known for presenting his on-air forecasts with detailed but fairly easy-to-understand analysis and striking accuracy (most noted by his predictions of the Groundhog Day blizzard two weeks before it created paralyzing effects on the Chicago area in late January and early February 2011), and with routine usage of ensemble computer models to illustrate expected weather scenarios. Skilling has also occasionally hosted half-hour documentary specials explaining extreme weather phenomenon and advancements in forecasting technology (including 1991's It Sounded Like a Freight Train, focusing on the science of and the Chicago area's climatological history with tornadoes, and 1992's When Lightning Strikes, centering on the science and dangers of lightning), which have earned several Chicago Emmy nominations and award wins, as well as a weekly feature on the 9\u00a0p.m. newscast, Ask Tom Why, in which Skilling answers viewer-submitted weather questions (and which served as the basis for a similarly formatted column featured in the Tribune's weather page). Under Skilling, WGN also coordinated the centralization of its weather operations to encompass WGN-TV, WGN Radio, CLTV and the Tribune, and, in May 2007, became a broadcast partner in the WeatherBug real-time automated weather observation network (the largest station member by market size). Skilling holds the record as the longest-serving television meteorologist at a single station in the Chicago market, having served as chief meteorologist at WGN-TV for 42 years as of August 2020[update]. (Volkman holds the record as Chicago's longest-serving television meteorologist overall, having worked in the market from 1959 until his retirement from broadcasting in 2004, including other stints at WMAQ-TV and WFLD as well as an 18-year run as chief meteorologist at WBBM-TV.)[273][274][275][276][277]\nThe late newscast was moved into prime time on March 10, 1980, concurrently becoming known as The Nine O'Clock News (later retitled WGN News at Nine in May 1993, as part of a uniform retitling of its newscasts under the \"WGN News\" moniker used in some promotions and report sign-offs since 1981). The shift to the 9\u00a0p.m. hour briefly made it the first hour-long prime time newscast in the Midwest and, for its first seven years in that slot, it was the Chicago market's only local television newscast at 9 p.m. Initially airing five nights a week for one hour, the revamped weeknight-only newscast was first anchored by the prior NewsNine team of Drury, Skilling, sports anchor Bill Frink and commentator Len O'Connor. On June 9 of that year, the program switched to a hybrid local-national format that incorporated the Independent Network News (INN)\u2014a Tribune-syndicated nightly news program originating from New York sister station WPIX, which was later retitled INN: The Independent News in September 1984 and USA Tonight in January 1987\u2014in place of the locally produced segments that had occupied the 9:30\u00a0p.m. half-hour since the March format change. After briefly being relegated to weeknights following the shift to prime time, half-hour weekend editions of the 9\u00a0p.m. broadcast were added on October 4, 1980, anchored originally by Larry Roderick and Robert Jordan.[278][279][280][281][282][283][284] By 1985, Drury (who returned to his previous role as main co-anchor at WLS-TV in late 1984) and Denise Cannon (who became the former's co-anchor in 1981 and departed at the end of 1984) were succeeded as principal anchors by Rick Rosenthal and Pat Harvey.\nSince the reformatting as a prime time newscast, WGN-TV has been the ratings leader in the 9\u00a0p.m. timeslot, with or without news competition in the arena and even at times when weaker-rated shows led into the newscast, and typically holds a larger audience than the 10\u00a0p.m. newscast on WBBM-TV. The 9\u00a0p.m. newscast's dominance was to such an extent that, from 1984 until 1989 (when it was unseated by KTVU in San Francisco), it had the largest viewership of any prime time local newscast in the United States. Legitimate competition sprang up for The Nine O'Clock News on November 16, 1987, when Fox O&O WFLD consolidated the half-hour 7 and 11\u00a0p.m. newscasts that launched its full-scale news operation three months earlier into a single broadcast at 9 p.m.[285][286][287] Although WFLD aggressively marketed its fledgling newscast towards younger audiences as having a fresher style compared to WGN's more traditional news format, viewer loyalty has continued to propel Channel 9 to No. 1 in the ratings at 9 p.m. to the present day (with one of the only exceptions being a tie with Channel 32 in the May 1996 sweeps period), even with the WFLD newscast having the Fox prime time lineup as its lead-in. For this reason, WFLD moved its newscast back to its original 7\u00a0p.m. timeslot in September 1988, only to return it to 9 p.m. the following year to accommodate the planned expansion of Fox's prime time lineup. A sports highlight and interview program, Instant Replay, which has been hosted since its debut by sports director Dan Roan, began accompanying the Sunday edition of the newscast in August 1987. WGN re-expanded its prime time newscast to one hour on June 4, 1990, after Tribune discontinued production of USA Tonight under a collaborative agreement between Tribune and Turner Broadcasting in which the Tribune stations were granted access to CNN Newsource content and began feeding video footage to the CNN video wire service.[288][289][290]\nWGN began programming long-form news outside its established 9\u00a0p.m. slot on September 19, 1983, when it debuted Midday Newscope, which grew out of the three-minute-long local news segments that had aired during the INN Midday Edition (which followed the newscast until that program's September 1985 cancellation) since January 1983. Originally anchored by Rick Rosenthal (who was replaced by Steve Sanders, after Rosenthal replaced Drury as 9\u00a0p.m. co-anchor in 1984), the newscast\u2014a local version of Telepictures and Gannett Broadcasting's short-lived syndicated format, Newscope\u2014featured a hybrid of local news headlines and weather forecasts and in-depth consumer, financial, entertainment and lifestyle features. The program was reformatted into a more traditional newscast, retitled Chicago's Midday News, on September 17, 1984, and later expanded to an hour in September 1985.[285][291][292][293] The midday newscast\u2014which concurrently rebranded from WGN News at Noon to the WGN Midday News with the expansion\u2014would eventually expand to 90 minutes (moving to an 11:30\u00a0a.m. start) on September 15, 2008; it was subsequently expanded to two hours (moving to 11\u00a0a.m.) on October 5, 2009.[294][295][296] On September 19, 1988, WGN became the first Chicago television station to closed caption its newscasts for the hearing impaired.\nOn January 25, 1992, the station debuted hour-long 8\u00a0a.m. newscasts on Saturdays and Sundays. To accommodate the launch of Chicago's Weekend Morning News (which marked the first major weekend morning news attempt in Chicago television and one of the only instances of a television station carrying a morning newscast on weekends without already having a weekday equivalent) and the concurring moves of Charlando and People to People to Sundays, WGN dropped three long-running religious programs\u2014What's Nu (produced by the Chicago Board of Rabbis), Heritage of Faith (produced by Protestant group Greater Chicago Broadcast Ministries) and Mass for Shut-ins (produced by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago)\u2014from its Sunday morning lineup, a move that was criticized by the Council of Religious Leaders of Metropolitan Chicago and other religious groups on grounds that the programs catered to diverse religious audiences in fulfillment of the station's public service programming obligations. (The latter two programs were subsequently acquired by WGBO-TV, under an agreement which allowed them to continue to be produced out of the WGN-TV studios.) The Sunday edition was discontinued after the September 4, 1994, broadcast; the Saturday edition would follow suit four years later on December 19, 1998, with then-news director Steve Ramsey citing the need to provide more resources for its weekday morning newscasts. Weekend morning newscasts returned on October 2, 2010, with the debut of hour-long editions at 6\u00a0a.m. (shifted to a two-hour block at 7\u00a0a.m. on September 10, 2016, following Channel 9's disaffiliation from The CW, and expanded to a third hour on Saturdays until 10\u00a0a.m. on January 11, 2020).[297][298][299][300][301][191]\nMorning news programming was extended to weekdays on September 6, 1994, with the WGN Morning News debuting as a one-hour broadcast from 7 to 8\u00a0a.m., anchored originally by Dave Eckert, Sonja Gantt and meteorologist Paul Huttner. In an effort to improve viewership, the program\u2014which replaced children's programs (including The Bozo Show, which displaced the Sunday edition of the morning newscast) that had previously aired in that time period\u2014was soon reformatted from a more traditional newscast to feature a mix of straight news and entertainment and lifestyle features that use a looser style similar to morning radio programs. This reformatting helped the Morning News to eventually begin beating competing local and national morning news programs\u2014including its closest initial competitor, WFLD's Fox Thing in the Morning (now Good Day Chicago)\u2014in the 25\u201354 age demographic and in total viewers. (The program would expand to two hours, extending until 9\u00a0a.m., on January 8, 1996, with a later hour-long expansion [to 10\u00a0a.m.] on September 3, 2013.) An hour-long 6\u00a0a.m. \"Early Edition\" of the newscast debuted on August 5, 1996; this block of the newscast would gradually expand to three hours, beginning with the addition of a 5:30\u00a0a.m. half-hour in January 2001 and ending with its July 11, 2011, extension to 4\u00a0a.m.[302][303][304][305] (The WGN Morning News became the first WGN-TV newscast to be denied clearance on the national feed in September 1996, with its forced removal reportedly being due to self-imposed exclusivity restrictions concerning the newscast's paid segments and rate charges that the station's sales department would have to pay if the segments aired nationally; simulcasts of the WGN Morning News temporarily returned to WGN America on February 3, 2014, when it began airing the 4\u00a0a.m. hour.)\nIn July 1996, WGN-TV began using a Eurocopter AS350 B2 helicopter for newsgathering, \"Skycam 9\", which is used for certain breaking news events and traffic reporting.[306] In October 1999, freelance reporter Jane Boal made headlines when she was hit from behind while trying to move away from a car attempting to drive away from an accident with another vehicle during a live midday report about a carbon monoxide leak that forced the evacuation of a school in the Rogers Park neighborhood; Boal (who was laid off by the station in May 2009) suffered cartilage and ligament injuries to both of her legs after being pinned between the car involved in the accident and a WGN live truck, but was able to resume work in early November.[307][308][309] In 2000, WGN-TV constructed a new 26,000-square-foot (2,415\u00a0m2) newsroom covering two floors on the eastern portion of its studio facility, increasing the building's size to approximately 131,000 square feet (12,170\u00a0m2); the original newsroom was renovated for use by the station's weather department.[310][311]\nWGN scored a major coup in April 2008, when it persuaded veteran WMAQ-TV and WFLD anchor Mark Suppelsa\u2014who turned down a contract with the latter station due to a proposed salary cut\u2014to take over as lead anchor of the 9\u00a0p.m. newscast, replacing Steve Sanders (who was moved to the midday newscast and was later joined in September 2009 by his former co-anchor on the 9\u00a0p.m. broadcast from 1993 until Suppelsa's appointment, Allison Payne, after Micah Materre moved to the prime time newscasts full-time). Suppelsa remained a main co-anchor of the weeknight newscasts until his retirement from broadcasting in December 2017, and was replaced two months later by Joe Donlon (who served a similar role at KGW in Portland, Oregon, and would himself depart WGN-TV in June 2020 to become main co-anchor of sister network WGN America's fledgling prime time newscast NewsNation).[312][296][313] On July 19, 2008, beginning with that night's edition of the 9\u00a0p.m. newscast, WGN-TV became the third television station in the Chicago market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. Video from remote and field equipment was initially broadcast in 480p standard definition following the transition; high definition cameras began to be used for field reports in July 2010, a move which made WGN-TV the first station in the market to broadcast all locally originated portions of its newscasts (including live field reports) in HD.\nStarting under the direction of now-former news director Greg Caputo, WGN-TV spearheaded a major expansion of its news programming. In addition to the expansions of its existing newscasts, WGN first launched an early-evening newscast on September 15, 2008, when the WGN Evening News premiered as a half-hour weeknight broadcast at 5:30\u00a0p.m.[294][295] The newscast expanded to one hour (starting at 5\u00a0p.m.) on October 5, 2009, with Saturday and Sunday editions being added on July 12, 2014.[296][314] The weekday editions of the newscast were later expanded to include a second hour (starting at 4\u00a0p.m.) on September 8, 2014, and then to three hours (extending it to the 6\u00a0p.m. hour) on April 4, 2017. (The superstation feed did not clear any of the expanded newscasts up until the conversion of WGN America into a conventional cable channel.)[315][316][317][318] In 2009, WGN-TV began streaming its weekday midday and 5\u00a0p.m. newscasts live on its website. On February 22, 2010, WGN-TV became the first television station in the Chicago market to allow iPhone users to watch live streams of its newscasts; the 6 to 9\u00a0a.m. block of the WGN Morning News, the midday and 5\u00a0p.m. newscasts were initially available for streaming to iPhone users. (At present, all newscasts are streamed through the station's website and on Apple devices, though sports segments are blacked out\u2014presented only with the audio feed\u2014due to streaming restrictions on sports highlights imposed by the major sports leagues.)[319]\nOn October 5, 2015, the station restored a 10\u00a0p.m. newscast\u2014originally only airing Monday through Friday nights\u2014to its schedule after a 35-year absence; weekend editions of the 10 p.m. broadcast were added on January 11, 2020.[320][321][191] A secondary live sports news show, GN Sports, premiered on January 28, 2020, as the lead-out program for the weeknight 10\u00a0p.m. newscasts; co-hosted by Dan Roan and Jarrett Payton, the program focuses on sports news and highlights, feature segments and in-studio interviews in a similar format as Instant Replay, as well as including sports gaming and fantasy sports analysis. (Payton formerly co-hosted the similar CLTV program Sports Feed\u2014alongside WGN sports reporter Josh Frydman, who serves as a GN Sports contributor\u2014from 2015 until Nexstar shut down the cable news channel in December 2019.)[257][322][323] Weekend editions of GN Sports were added on August 14, 2021, with the Sunday broadcast replacing the cuisine and tourism program Chicago's Best (which had aired on WGN for ten years from January 2011 until August 8, 2021).[324][325][326]\n\nNotable on-air staff[edit]\nCurrent staff\nJackie Bange \u2013 weekend evening anchor\nLourdes Duarte \u2013 weekday afternoon anchor\nTim Joyce \u2013 weekend morning meteorologist\nPaul M.

(Incidentally, WGN-TV was one of six, originally eight, Chicago television stations that declined offers to move their analog transmitters to the Sears Tower antenna farm ahead of the building's 1973 completion.)[367][368] The station shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 9, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The WGN-TV digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 19, with digital television receivers continuing to display WGN-TV's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 9. As a consequence, WGN-TV permanently ceased transmissions from the John Hancock Center's west antenna tower, establishing its existing digital facilities at the Sears Tower digital antenna as its main transmitter.[369][370]\nThough not a participant in the SAFER Act, WWME-CA carried simulcasts of WGN-TV's 9\u00a0p.m. newscast\u2014except in the event of sports delays\u2014and WMAQ-TV's morning and early evening newscasts until July 12 to provide an analog \"lifeline\" for viewers that were unprepared for or who had reception issues following the digital transition.[371][372][373]\n\nCanadian distribution[edit]\nIn April 1985, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved eligibility for the signals of WGN-TV and fellow American superstations WTBS, WOR-TV and WPIX to be retransmitted as foreign services by multichannel television providers within Canada. Under CRTC linkage rules first implemented in 1983 that require providers to offer U.S.-based program services in discretionary tiers tied to Canadian services, WGN-TV/WGN America and other authorized U.S. superstations typically have been sold to prospective subscribers of one or more domestic premium services\u2014such as Crave (formerly First Choice and The Movie Network), Starz (formerly Moviepix and The Movie Network Encore), Super Channel, Super \u00c9cran and Western Canada-based regional pay services Movie Central (the original user of the Superchannel name, now defunct) and Encore Avenue (also now defunct). However, some providers have chosen to offer WGN in a specialty tier under a related rule that allows for an eligible superstation of the provider's choice to be carried on a non-premium tier. (Although KWGN-TV has also been authorized for carriage by the CRTC since that point, the Denver sister station is not carried on any multichannel television providers within Canada.)[374][375][376]\nAfter United Video began offering a separate national feed of WGN upon the stateside implementation the Syndex rules in January 1990, most Canadian cable providers began to replace the Chicago signal with the superstation feed as well. (Among the country's satellite providers, Star Choice [now Shaw Direct] began carrying the national feed upon the satellite provider's 1994 launch; Bell ExpressVu [now Bell Satellite TV] began distributing the Chicago-area signal when it commenced operations in 1996.) As a network affiliate, WGN-TV provided WB and CW programs to areas of Canada distant from the Canadian\u2013U.S. border that could not receive over-the-air signals of other WB/CW affiliates from American cities. The WGN local feed was subjected to fewer sports blackouts than WGN America had been subjected to prior to the separation of the national and local feeds, as blackouts of programming to which Canadian broadcasters hold domestic rights apply only to imported U.S.-based specialty channels. However, simultaneous substitution rules have applied to certain CW programs that were also carried by Canadian-based terrestrial networks (such as Global, Citytv and CTV Two). The WGN-TV feed had also previously been available as part of the NHL Centre Ice sports package, primarily for simulcasts of Chicago Blackhawks games that WGN-TV aired until the 2018\u201319 season.\nOn January 17, 2007, WGN's main Canadian uplink carrier, Shaw Broadcast Services, switched its distributed feed of the station to the Chicago signal, a decision believed to have resulted from increased licensing fees for the then-superstation feed; despite this, some providers (including MTS TV and Cogeco Cable) continued to carry the superstation feed in place of or in conjunction with the Chicago signal. Despite this, some providers continued to carry the national WGN channel in lieu of or\u2014as was the case with providers such as MTS TV and Cogeco Cable\u2014in tandem with the Chicago feed, resulting in the duplication of CW network and many syndicated programs that are available within the country on other networks (such as fellow superstations KTLA and Boston-based WSBK-TV). While the CRTC had approved the Chicago station's broadcast signal and its national cable feed for carriage on any domestic multichannel television provider (including cable, satellite, IPTV and MMDS services), because of the conversion of WGN America from a superstation into an independent general-entertainment service and its resulting programming separation from WGN-TV, on December 15, 2014, Tribune Broadcasting sent notice that it would terminate all Canadian distribution rights for WGN America, effective January 1, 2015;[377] the move was likely done to comply with CRTC genre protection rules in effect at the time, which prohibited the utilization of general entertainment programming formats by domestic or foreign cable channels. The WGN-TV Chicago feed, however, remains authorized for domestic distribution as a superstation. It is carried on Bell Satellite TV channel 1232 across Canada.[378]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Even though WGNB operated on 98.7 FM, the same frequency that WFMT currently does (and which Tribune later purchased in the 1960s), there is no continuity between the two stations.\n\n^ WGN representatives had to amend the application to use channel 9 as its proposed channel assignment after realizing that the initial application listed VHF channel 4, which had already been assigned to Balaban and Katz Broadcasting for the fledgling WBKB-TV, as the allocation for the proposed station.\n\n^ McCormick was too ill to attend the event himself; consequently, his speech was read at the ceremony by a business associate.\n\n^ UPT absorbed WBKB parent Balaban and Katz in March 1949, after Paramount Pictures divested its chain of movie theaters by order of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n^ WGN moved to the Pioneer Court extension on North Michigan Avenue in 1986, before eventually resuming operations at the Tribune Tower in October 2012.\n\n^ Tribune sold the complex to a joint venture between local real estate firms R2 Companies and Polsky Holdings for $22.25 million on January 31, 2017, in a deal that allowed WGN-TV to lease the property for a minimum of ten years.[48][49][50][51][52][53]\n\n^ Before adding Local TV's nine ABC-, NBC- and CBS-affiliated stations through that purchase, Tribune's television properties had historically consisted mainly of independent stations or, from 1995 onward, affiliates of networks that debuted after 1986 [Fox, The WB, The CW and MyNetworkTV].[72]\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Commercial Broadcast Stations Biennial Ownership Report (FCC Form 323), Federal Communications Commission, January 31, 2020, p.\u00a011, retrieved February 2, 2020\n\n^ \"Facility Technical Data for WGN-TV\".

The party organizes for a revolution to overthrow the system of capitalism and replace it with a socialist state, with the final aim of world communism.[1] The RCP is frequently described as a cult around Avakian.[2][3][4]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nBay Area Revolutionary Union[edit]\nIn early 1968, Avakian, Leibel Bergman, H. Bruce Franklin, Stephen Charles Hamilton and a score or so others\u2014comprising both veterans of the Communist Party USA and Bay Area radicals based in Palo Alto, Berkeley, and San Francisco, formed the Bay Area Revolutionary Union (BARU). Among the BARU's first tasks was to challenge the Maoist Progressive Labor Party (PLP) over its positions on the Black Panther Party, the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the direction of Maoism. The early RU joined with the Revolutionary Youth Movement faction in the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in opposing PLP's role in SDS at its national convention in Chicago in 1969. The resulting split led to PL controlling the SDS name, while RYM split into two factions.[5]\nThe RU organized on a revolutionary anti-revisionist Marxist\u2013Leninist\u2013Maoist party line, with emphasis on the Black liberation struggle and the liberation of all colonized peoples in and outside the United States. This political philosophy was elaborated in the 1969 pamphlet The Red Papers (later known as Red Papers I, after subsequent publications).[6][7]\nIn 1971, Franklin led a more militant faction of BARU out of the organization to join Venceremos. The RU continued to expand, uniting collectives[8] across the country and becoming a national organization with the long-term goal to form a new communist party. The new nationwide structure induced BARU to change its name to simply the Revolutionary Union (RU). Avakian was elected to the central committee of the RU shortly thereafter. The RCP claims that of the various groups coming out of SDS, it was the first to seriously attempt to develop itself at the theoretical level, with the publication of Red Papers 1.[9] In 1974, RU started publication of its newspaper Revolution (renamed Revolutionary Worker, and adopting a weekly format in 1979).\nIn 1973, the anti-war group Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) entered into reforms after the end of the Vietnam War, including an explicitly anti-imperialist stance and opening its membership to civilians. During this period, the RU became a popular faction within the VVAW, and RU members gained influential positions in the VVAW, including in the national council.[10] This reached its peak in 1975, when the RU-controlled national office voted to remove members, expel chapters and place the organization into ideological uniformity.[11] They later voted to dissolve themselves into the Revolutionary Union.\nA reconstituted group of non-Marxist members of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War filed and won a lawsuit prohibiting the RU-dominated group from using the VVAW name, logos and materials.[12] Deep animosity persists between the two organizations.[10] The RU organization was renamed Vietnam Veterans Against the War Anti-Imperialist (VVAW-AI).\n\nFormation[edit]\nIn September 1975, after the integration of the Revolutionary Union's faction of the VVAW, RU reconstituted itself as the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP).[13]\nAfter the death of Mao in 1976, the RCP split, with about 40% of its membership leaving, over which position to take in relation to the new Chinese leadership. Avakian led the majority of the party that rejected what it analyzed as a counterrevolutionary coup against Mao's allies. After this split, Avakian wrote and published the book Mao Tsetung's Immortal Contributions,[14] which summarizes the developments of Maoism.\nIn January 1979, Avakian and 78 other Party members and supporters were arrested and charged with various crimes in connection to a militant protest against Deng Xiaoping's visit to the White House. Seventeen demonstrators, including Avakian, were charged with multiple felonies that carried a combined sentence of up to 241 years.[15] After the RCP and its supporters waged a mass campaign for political, legal, and other support for the defendants, the charges were dropped in 1982, by which time Party leadership had decided to go into exile, with Avakian applying for political asylum in France, where he remained for many years.\n\n1980s\u20132000s[edit]\nThis section relies excessively on references to primary sources. Please improve this section by adding secondary or tertiary sources.

Shortly thereafter, on April 22, Garcia was stabbed to death[17] while organizing in a Los Angeles housing project. At the time, police said that Garcia's murderer was gang-affiliated, while RCP insisted that he had been assassinated by the state in retaliation for his action at the Alamo. Avakian remarked in his memoir that Garcia's murder was \"very clearly tied in with police agents ... it was an attack on our Party.\"[18]\nIn 1984 Avakian and other members of the RCP co-founded the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (RIM), a now-defunct international grouping of Maoist parties, which were united by a founding declaration upholding Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. Other participating parties in RIM included the Communist Party of Peru (Shining Path), the Union of Iranian Communists (Sarbedaran), and the Revolutionary Communist Group of Colombia. RIM published and distributed the magazine and news service A World to Win from 1981 to 2006. Since RIM's dissolution in the 2000s, the publication is updated only on its website. In 2017, A World to Win was restructured as \"a more thorough-going tool for revolution based on Bob Avakian's new synthesis of communism.\"[19]\nFlag-burning by RCP members led to the Texas v. Johnson case, which established the burning of the American flag as a constitutionally protected right.[citation needed]\n\n2010s[edit]\nIn 2011, RCP spokesperson Carl Dix and Cornel West co-initiated the campaigns to Stop \"Stop and Frisk\" and Stop Mass Incarceration.[20][21] Dix and West appeared on Democracy Now! to discuss the state of Black America in the age of Obama.[22] RCP organized Rise Up October against racism and police brutality; attendees included Quentin Tarantino.[23]\nIn July 2016, mass protest and police arrests erupted over a flag-burning by the RCP outside the Republican National Convention before a crowd of thousands.[24][25] The next week, the RCP staged another flag burning outside the Democratic National Convention after denouncing the United States.[26] Later that year, in response to Donald Trump's tweet calling for the criminalization of flag burning, RCP supporters burned another American flag outside the Trump International Hotel in New York City.[27]\nIn October 2016, RCP supporters were banned from the University of Chicago for trespassing after encouraging students to get organized with the revolutionaries, with one activist arrested by police;[28] the next day, they returned to defy the ban, while denouncing U.S. elections and America.[29][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nIn August 2016, the RCP led protesters in a two-day march on a barricaded police station after the fatal shooting of a black man by Milwaukee police;[30] the police chief said the RCP had incited violence toward police.[31]\n\nRCP supporters at an immigration rights march in Chicago, 2019.\nRCP members handed out fliers outside the San Diego Levi's Stadium in support of Colin Kaepernick and NFL protests of the U.S. national anthem.[32]\nIn December 2016, in response to the election of Donald Trump, the RCP helped initiate and lead the ad-hoc coalition Refuse Fascism, which had as its goal the prevention of Trump's inauguration through mass political protest and civil disobedience. After the inauguration, the organization adjusted to a mission of launching sustained mass protests aimed at forcing the removal of the Trump administration before the scheduled election of 2020.[citation needed]\nIn July 2018, Refuse Fascism and RCP organized 100 handmaids to protest U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in New York City, saying \"[he] is a Christian fascist theocrat for whom the handmaid's tale is a model.\"[33][original research?]\nIn October 2018, the RCP organized a demonstration in Chicago's Daley Plaza on the 23rd Annual \"National Day of Protest to STOP Police Brutality,\" in response to the police murder of Laquan McDonald and other black youth.[34][35]\nDuring the Q&A at a February 2019 event at USC, RCP supporters sparked controversy after criticizing speaker Amanda Nguyen's work in the U.S. government during the War on Terror.[36][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nIn March 2019, police detained a Revolution Newspaper correspondent on the anniversary of the police shooting of Stephon Clark, after the correspondent got into an argument with Al Sharpton while urging attendees to organize for revolution rather than political reforms.[37]\nOn International Women's Day 2019, the Revolution Club joined supporters of the Communist Party of Iran (Marxist\u2013Leninist\u2013Maoist), to march through Westwood, California, calling for universal women's rights.[38][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nOn Independence Day 2019, the RCP staged flag burnings at the U.S.\u2013Mexico border and the White House, the latter being a demonstration against the \"Salute to America\" military parade, which resulted in two RCP supporters being attacked by the Proud Boys and arrested by Secret Service officers.[39][40]\n\nPolitical ideology[edit]\nThe RCP originated as a Maoist political organization with roots in the New Left of the 1970s.[41] In the 1990s, its political ideology was Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism.[42] Today, the framework for its political ideology is Avakian's \"New Synthesis\" (or \"New Communism\"), which it sees as an advancement of revolutionary theory; this has been debated among Maoists internationally.[43][44] The RCP is atheist and claim to stress the scientific method.[45]\nRCP leadership says \"the system cannot be reformed, it must be overthrown,\"[46] and does not participate in charity or elections,[47] instead organizing for total revolution,[48] to replace the capitalist system with a socialist system aiming for communism worldwide.[49] Its goal is not to \"make America socialist\" but instead \"a world without America and everything it stands for.\"[50]\n\nRCP posters in Cleveland, 2023.\nSince the 2000s, Avakian's \"new communism\" is the RCP's ideological framework,[51] which it considers a scientific advancement of Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism. Before that, the party was a founding member of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement.\n\nCult of personality[edit]\nThe RCP began developing a cult of personality around Avakian as part of the 1979 pivot catalyzed by the Deng Xiaoping protest trial. The goal was to both increase support for Avakian in the legal arena while also making RCP a more revolutionary organization, inspired by Joseph Stalin's cult of personality, Mao Zedong's cult of personality, and the more recent Free Huey! campaign in which Avakian had participated. Relying on the theory of Georgy Plekhanov and framing the development of a cult as a scientific organizational strategy, Avakian was put forward as a larger-than-life figure to revitalize the group.[52]\nMembers of both the left and the broader public often see the RCP as a small cult around Avakian. This perception was noted in The Indypendent in 2014,[53] Harper's in 2016,[54] Mic in 2017,[55] and Vice magazine in 2022.[56] Members and groups on the left, in organized labor, and in protest movements have called RCP a cult. In 2016, former USLAW national coordinator Michael Eisenscher called RCP primarily \"a cult around Avakian\".[54] In June 2022, a coalition of 23 abortion rights, feminist, and mutual-aid groups released a statement denouncing RCP and the affiliated organization Rise Up 4 Abortion Rights, including a description of RCP as a cult.[56][57][58]\nRCP members celebrate the organization as a cult of personality around Avakian.[59][60][54] RCP publications say that the RCP and Avakian have encouraged controversy and serious debate over their views and a wide range of issues, engaging in numerous debates and polemics, while also taking a strong stand against destructive allegations in place of principled dialogue and building unity for what they term \"the emancipation of humanity\".[61][62][63][64][non-primary source needed]\n\nLGBT issues[edit]\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the RCP called homosexuality \"petty bourgeois\" and prohibited LGBT people from joining the party.[65][66][67] This outlook coexisted with a public line against gay-bashing and attacks on homosexuals by religious bigots and fundamentalists, and was consistent with numerous groups of the New Communist movement and the broader Marxist\u2013Leninist movement of the period.[68] The party's policy against homosexuality ended in 2001.[69] The RCP platform now demands full recognition of LGBT rights as a fundamental element of establishing socialism.[70]\n\nActivities[edit]\nThe RCP releases daily updates online and a periodic print edition of its weekly newspaper, Revolution (formerly called Revolutionary Worker, 1979\u20132005), in English and Spanish.\nIn December 2016, party members and others co-initiated Refuse Fascism, a coalition group aiming to \"drive out\" the Trump administration through sustained street protests.[71] InfoWars and other far-right conspiracy theory websites claimed the RCP and Refuse Fascism were organizing a military overthrow of the government on November 4, 2017.[72] Several nationwide anti-Trump protest marches were organized for that day, numbering in the thousands.[73][74]\nRefuse Fascism protesters were arrested in September 2017 after blocking four lanes of the 101 Freeway in Los Angeles during rush hour, to \"sound the alarm about fascism.\"[75][76]\nRCP supporters Michael Slate and Sunsara Taylor have regularly aired shows on radio networks KPFK[77] and WBAI,[78] respectively, where they discuss news and politics with guests.\n\nRevolution Books[edit]\nRCP branches opened Revolution Books stores in major U.S. cities and became a frequent presence in protest movements.[47]\n\nPrison outreach[edit]\nThe RCP runs the Prisoners Revolutionary Literature Fund,[79] which sends its newspaper and other political works from its publishing press to hundreds of incarcerated people nationwide to spread a revolutionary message.[80] As its aim, the fund \"provides an educational opportunity for prisoners to engage with world events and key political, cultural, and philosophical questions from a unique communistic perspective, including discussions of morality, religion, science, and the arts centered around a positive socialist-light.\"[81]\nThe RCP has faced increasing censorship by prison officials who seek to deny inmates access to revolutionary literature.[82]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ USA, Revolutionary Communist Party (2010).

It is a massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by energy produced by nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Part of this internal energy is emitted from its surface as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, providing most of the energy for life on Earth.\nThe Sun moves around the Galactic Center of the Milky Way, at a distance of 26,660 light-years. From Earth, it is on average 1\u00a0AU (1.496\u00d7108\u00a0km) or about 8 light-minutes away. Its diameter is about 1,391,400\u00a0km (864,600\u00a0mi; 4.64 ls), 109 times that of Earth or 4 lunar distances. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.[16] Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.[17]\nThe Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), informally called a yellow dwarf, though its light is actually white. It formed approximately 4.6\u00a0billion[a][13][18] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.\nEvery second, the Sun's core fuses about 600\u00a0million tons of hydrogen into helium, and in the process converts 4\u00a0million tons of matter into energy. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. Far in the future, when hydrogen fusion in the Sun's core diminishes to the point where the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature which will push its outer layers to expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. This process will make the Sun large enough to render Earth uninhabitable approximately five billion years from the present. After this, the Sun will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star (a white dwarf), and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion for trillions of years. After that it is theorized to become a super dense black dwarf, giving off no more energy.\nThe enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times; the Sun was thought of by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of some solar calendars. The predominant calendar in use today is the Gregorian calendar, which is based upon the standard 16th-century interpretation of the Sun's observed movement as actual movement.[19]\n\n\nEtymology\nThe English word sun developed from Old English sunne. Cognates appear in other Germanic languages, including West Frisian sinne, Dutch zon, Low German S\u00fcnn, Standard German Sonne, Bavarian Sunna, Old Norse sunna, and Gothic sunn\u014d. All these words stem from Proto-Germanic *sunn\u014dn.[20][21] This is ultimately related to the word for sun in other branches of the Indo-European language family, though in most cases a nominative stem with an l is found, rather than the genitive stem in n, as for example in Latin s\u014dl, ancient Greek \u1f25\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (h\u0113lios), Welsh haul and Czech slunce, as well as (with *l > r) Sanskrit \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930 (sv\u00e1r) and Persian \u062e\u0648\u0631 (xvar). Indeed, the l-stem survived in Proto-Germanic as well, as *s\u014dwelan, which gave rise to Gothic sauil (alongside sunn\u014d) and Old Norse prosaic s\u00f3l (alongside poetic sunna), and through it the words for sun in the modern Scandinavian languages: Swedish and Danish sol, Icelandic s\u00f3l, etc.[21]\nThe principal adjectives for the Sun in English are sunny for sunlight and, in technical contexts, solar (/\u02c8so\u028al\u0259r/),[3] from Latin sol[22] \u2013 the latter found in terms such as solar day, solar eclipse and Solar System. From the Greek helios comes the rare adjective heliac (/\u02c8hi\u02d0li\u00e6k/).[23] In English, the Greek and Latin words occur in poetry as personifications of the Sun, Helios (/\u02c8hi\u02d0li\u0259s/) and Sol (/\u02c8s\u0252l/),[2][1] while in science fiction Sol may be used to distinguish the Sun from other stars. The term sol with a lower-case s is used by planetary astronomers for the duration of a solar day on another planet such as Mars.[24]\nThe English weekday name Sunday stems from Old English Sunnand\u00e6g \"sun's day\", a Germanic interpretation of the Latin phrase di\u0113s s\u014dlis, itself a translation of the ancient Greek \u1f21\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u1f21\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 (h\u0113mera h\u0113liou) 'day of the sun'.[25] The astronomical symbol for the Sun is a circle with a center dot, . It is used for such units as M\u2609 (Solar mass), R\u2609 (Solar radius) and L\u2609 (Solar luminosity).\n\nGeneral characteristics\nThe Sun is a G-type main-sequence star that makes up about 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System. The Sun has an absolute magnitude of +4.83, estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs.[26][27] The Sun is a Population I, or heavy-element-rich,[b] star.[28] Its formation may have been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby supernovae.[29] This is suggested by a high abundance of heavy elements in the Solar System, such as gold and uranium, relative to the abundances of these elements in so-called Population II, heavy-element-poor, stars. The heavy elements could most plausibly have been produced by endothermic nuclear reactions during a supernova, or by transmutation through neutron absorption within a massive second-generation star.[28]\nThe Sun is by far the brightest object in the Earth's sky, with an apparent magnitude of \u221226.74.[30][31] This is about 13\u00a0billion times brighter than the next brightest star, Sirius, which has an apparent magnitude of \u22121.46.\nOne astronomical unit (about 150\u00a0million kilometres; 93\u00a0million miles) is defined as the mean distance of the Sun's center to Earth's center, though the distance varies (by about +/- 2.5 million km or 1.55 million miles) as Earth moves from perihelion on about 3 January to aphelion on about 4 July.[32] The distances can vary between 147,098,074\u00a0km (perihelion) and 152,097,701\u00a0km (aphelion), and extreme values can range from 147,083,346\u00a0km to 152,112,126\u00a0km.[33] At its average distance, light travels from the Sun's horizon to Earth's horizon in about 8 minutes and 20 seconds,[34] while light from the closest points of the Sun and Earth takes about two seconds less. The energy of this sunlight supports almost all life[c] on Earth by photosynthesis,[35] and drives Earth's climate and weather.\nThe Sun does not have a definite boundary, but its density decreases exponentially with increasing height above the photosphere.[36] For the purpose of measurement, the Sun's radius is considered to be the distance from its center to the edge of the photosphere, the apparent visible surface of the Sun.[37] By this measure, the Sun is a near-perfect sphere with an oblateness estimated at 9\u00a0millionths,[38][39][40] which means that its polar diameter differs from its equatorial diameter by only 10 kilometers (6.2\u00a0mi).[41] The tidal effect of the planets is weak and does not significantly affect the shape of the Sun.[42] The Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles. This differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the Coriolis force due to the Sun's rotation. In a frame of reference defined by the stars, the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent rotational period of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.[43] Viewed from a vantage point above its north pole, the Sun rotates counterclockwise around its axis of spin.[d][44]\n\nComposition\nSee also: Molecules in stars\nThe Sun consists primarily of the chemical elements hydrogen and helium. At this time in the Sun's life, they account for 74.9% and 23.8%, respectively, of the mass of the Sun in the photosphere.[45] All heavier elements, called metals in astronomy, account for less than 2% of the mass, with oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%) being the most abundant.[46]\nIn solar research it is more common to express the abundance of each element in dex, which is a scaled logarithmic unit. \n\n\n\n\nA\n\n(\ne\n)\n=\n12\n+\n\nlog\n\n10\n\n\n\u2061\n(\n\n\n\nn\ne\n\n\nn\n\nH\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {A} (e)=12+\\log _{10}({\\frac {ne}{n\\mathrm {H} }})}\n\n, with 'e' being the element in question and nH as 1012 hydrogen atoms. By definition hydrogen has an abundance of 12, the helium abundance varies between roughly 10.3 and 10.5 depending on the phase of the Solar cycle,[47] Carbon is 8.47, Neon is 8.29, Oxygen is 7.69[48] and iron is 7.62.\nThe Sun's original chemical composition was inherited from the interstellar medium out of which it formed. Originally it would have contained about 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.[45] The hydrogen and most of the helium in the Sun would have been produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis in the first 20 minutes of the universe, and the heavier elements were produced by previous generations of stars before the Sun was formed, and spread into the interstellar medium during the final stages of stellar life and by events such as supernovae.[49]\nSince the Sun formed, the main fusion process has involved fusing hydrogen into helium. Over the past 4.6\u00a0billion years, the amount of helium and its location within the Sun has gradually changed. Within the core, the proportion of helium has increased from about 24% to about 60% due to fusion, and some of the helium and heavy elements have settled from the photosphere towards the center of the Sun because of gravity. The proportions of heavier elements are unchanged. Heat is transferred outward from the Sun's core by radiation rather than by convection (see Radiative zone below), so the fusion products are not lifted outward by heat; they remain in the core[50] and gradually an inner core of helium has begun to form that cannot be fused because presently the Sun's core is not hot or dense enough to fuse helium. In the current photosphere, the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of what it was in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). In the future, helium will continue to accumulate in the core, and in about 5\u00a0billion years this gradual build-up will eventually cause the Sun to exit the main sequence and become a red giant.[51]\nThe chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System.[52] The solar heavy-element abundances described above are typically measured both using spectroscopy of the Sun's photosphere and by measuring abundances in meteorites that have never been heated to melting temperatures. These meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the protostellar Sun and are thus not affected by the settling of heavy elements. The two methods generally agree well.[17]\n\nStructure and fusion\nMain article: Standard solar model\nIllustration of the Sun's structure, in false color for contrast\nCore\nMain article: Solar core\nThe core of the Sun extends from the center to about 20\u201325% of the solar radius.[53] It has a density of up to 150\u00a0g/cm3[54][55] (about 150 times the density of water) and a temperature of close to 15.7 million Kelvin (K).[55] By contrast, the Sun's surface temperature is approximately 5800\u00a0K. Recent analysis of SOHO mission data favors a faster rotation rate in the core than in the radiative zone above.[53] Through most of the Sun's life, energy has been produced by nuclear fusion in the core region through the proton\u2013proton chain; this process converts hydrogen into helium.[56] Currently, only 0.8% of the energy generated in the Sun comes from another sequence of fusion reactions called the CNO cycle, though this proportion is expected to increase as the Sun becomes older and more luminous.[57][58]\nThe core is the only region on the Sun that produces an appreciable amount of thermal energy through fusion; 99% of the power is generated within 24% of the Sun's radius, and by 30% of the radius, fusion has stopped nearly entirely. The remainder of the Sun is heated by this energy as it is transferred outwards through many successive layers, finally to the solar photosphere where it escapes into space through radiation (photons) or advection (massive particles).[59][60]\n\nIllustration of a proton-proton reaction chain, from hydrogen forming deuterium, helium-3, and regular helium-4\nThe proton\u2013proton chain occurs around 9.2\u00d71037 times each second in the core, converting about 3.7\u00d71038 protons into alpha particles (helium nuclei) every second (out of a total of ~8.9\u00d71056 free protons in the Sun), or about 6.2\u00d71011\u00a0kg/s. However, each proton (on average) takes around 9 billion years to fuse with one another using the PP chain.[59] Fusing four free protons (hydrogen nuclei) into a single alpha particle (helium nucleus) releases around 0.7% of the fused mass as energy,[61] so the Sun releases energy at the mass\u2013energy conversion rate of 4.26\u00a0million metric tons per second (which requires 600 metric megatons of hydrogen[62]), for 384.6\u00a0yottawatts (3.846\u00d71026\u00a0W),[5] or 9.192\u00d71010\u00a0megatons of TNT per second. The large power output of the Sun is mainly due to the huge size and density of its core (compared to Earth and objects on Earth), with only a fairly small amount of power being generated per cubic metre. Theoretical models of the Sun's interior indicate a maximum power density, or energy production, of approximately 276.5 watts per cubic metre at the center of the core,[63] which, according to Karl Kruszelnicki, is about the same power density inside a compost pile.[64]\nThe fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and expand slightly against the weight of the outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.[65][66]\n\nRadiative zone\nMain article: Radiative zone\nIllustration of different stars' internal structure. The Sun in the middle has an inner radiating zone and an outer convective zone.\nThe radiative zone is the thickest layer of the Sun, at 0.45 solar radii. From the core out to about 0.7 solar radii, thermal radiation is the primary means of energy transfer.[67] The temperature drops from approximately 7\u00a0million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core.[55] This temperature gradient is less than the value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection.[55] Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions.[67] The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 000\u00a0kg/m3 to 200\u00a0kg/m3) between 0.25 solar radii and 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.[67]\n\nTachocline\nMain article: Tachocline\nThe radiative zone and the convective zone are separated by a transition layer, the tachocline. This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear between the two\u2014a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another.[68] Presently, it is hypothesized (see Solar dynamo) that a magnetic dynamo within this layer generates the Sun's magnetic field.[55]\n\nConvective zone\nMain article: Convection zone\nThe Sun's convection zone extends from 0.7 solar radii (500,000\u00a0km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, the density of the plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry most of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks to the base of the convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K (350-fold) and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/10,000 the density of air at sea level, and 1 millionth that of the inner layer of the convective zone).[55]\nThe thermal columns of the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun giving it a granular appearance called the solar granulation at the smallest scale and supergranulation at larger scales. Turbulent convection in this outer part of the solar interior sustains \"small-scale\" dynamo action over the near-surface volume of the Sun.[55] The Sun's thermal columns are B\u00e9nard cells and take the shape of roughly hexagonal prisms.[69]\n\nPhotosphere\nMain article: Photosphere\nHigh-resolution image of the Sun's surface taken by the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST)\nThe visible surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to visible light.[70] Photons produced in this layer escape the Sun through the transparent solar atmosphere above it and become solar radiation, sunlight. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H\u2212 ions, which absorb visible light easily.[70] Conversely, the visible light we see is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H\u2212 ions.[71][72]\nThe photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, and is slightly less opaque than air on Earth. Because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than the lower part, an image of the Sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or limb of the solar disk, in a phenomenon known as limb darkening.[70] The spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a black-body radiating at 5,777\u00a0K (5,504\u00a0\u00b0C; 9,939\u00a0\u00b0F), interspersed with atomic absorption lines from the tenuous layers above the photosphere. The photosphere has a particle density of ~1023\u00a0m\u22123 (about 0.37% of the particle number per volume of Earth's atmosphere at sea level). The photosphere is not fully ionized\u2014the extent of ionization is about 3%, leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form.[73]\nDuring early studies of the optical spectrum of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any chemical elements then known on Earth. In 1868, Norman Lockyer hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed helium, after the Greek Sun god Helios. Twenty-five years later, helium was isolated on Earth.[74]\n\nAtmosphere\nMain article: Stellar atmosphere\nThe Sun's atmosphere is composed of four parts: the photosphere (visible under normal conditions), the chromosphere, the transition region, the corona and the heliosphere. During a total solar eclipse, the photosphere is blocked, making the corona visible.[75]\nThe coolest layer of the Sun is a temperature minimum region extending to about 500\u00a0km above the photosphere, and has a temperature of about 4,100\u00a0K.[70] This part of the Sun is cool enough to allow for the existence of simple molecules such as carbon monoxide and water, which can be detected via their absorption spectra.[76]\nThe chromosphere, transition region, and corona are much hotter than the surface of the Sun.[70] The reason is not well understood, but evidence suggests that Alfv\u00e9n waves may have enough energy to heat the corona.[77]\n\nThe Sun's transition region taken by Hinode's Solar Optical Telescope\nAbove the temperature minimum layer is a layer about 2,000\u00a0km thick, dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines.[70] It is called the chromosphere from the Greek root chroma, meaning color, because the chromosphere is visible as a colored flash at the beginning and end of total solar eclipses.[67] The temperature of the chromosphere increases gradually with altitude, ranging up to around 20,000\u00a0K near the top.[70] In the upper part of the chromosphere helium becomes partially ionized.[78]\n\nAbove the chromosphere, in a thin (about 200\u00a0km) transition region, the temperature rises rapidly from around 20,000\u00a0K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000\u00a0K.[79] The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma.[78] The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion.[67] The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.[80]During a total solar eclipse, the solar corona can be seen with the naked eye, during the brief period of totality.\nThe corona is the next layer of the Sun. The low corona, near the surface of the Sun, has a particle density around 1015\u00a0m\u22123 to 1016\u00a0m\u22123.[78][e] The average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about 1,000,000\u20132,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000\u201320,000,000 K.[79] Although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection.[79][81]\nThe corona is the extended atmosphere of the Sun, which has a volume much larger than the volume enclosed by the Sun's photosphere. A flow of plasma outward from the Sun into interplanetary space is the solar wind.[81]\nThe heliosphere, the tenuous outermost atmosphere of the Sun, is filled with solar wind plasma. This outermost layer of the Sun is defined to begin at the distance where the flow of the solar wind becomes superalfv\u00e9nic\u2014that is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of Alfv\u00e9n waves,[82] at approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU). Turbulence and dynamic forces in the heliosphere cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfv\u00e9n waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere,[83][84] forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape,[81] until it impacts the heliopause more than 50\u00a0AU from the Sun. In December 2004, the Voyager 1 probe passed through a shock front that is thought to be part of the heliopause.[85] In late 2012 Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium,[86] and indeed did so August 25, 2012 at approximately 122 astronomical units (18 Tm) from the Sun.[87] The heliosphere has a heliotail which stretches out behind it due to the Sun's movement.[88]\nOn April 28, 2021, during its eighth flyby of the Sun, NASA's Parker Solar Probe encountered the specific magnetic and particle conditions at 18.8 solar radii that indicated that it penetrated the Alfv\u00e9n surface, the boundary separating the corona from the solar wind defined as where the coronal plasma's Alfv\u00e9n speed and the large-scale solar wind speed are equal.[89][90] The probe measured the solar wind plasma environment with its FIELDS and SWEAP instruments.[91] This event was described by NASA as \"touching the Sun\".[89] During the flyby, Parker Solar Probe passed into and out of the corona several times. This proved the predictions that the Alfv\u00e9n critical surface is not shaped like a smooth ball, but has spikes and valleys that wrinkle its surface.[89]\n\nSunlight and neutrinos\nMain articles: Sunlight and Solar irradiance\nThe Sun seen through a light fog\nThe Sun emits light across the visible spectrum, so its color is white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), when viewed from space or when the Sun is high in the sky. The Solar radiance per wavelength peaks in the green portion of the spectrum when viewed from space.[92][93] When the Sun is very low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta, and in rare occasions even green or blue. Despite its typical whiteness (white sunrays, white ambient light, white illumination of the Moon, etc.), some cultures mentally picture the Sun as yellow and some even red; the reasons for this are cultural and exact ones are the subject of debate.[94]\nThe Sun is a G2V star, with G2 indicating its surface temperature of approximately 5,778\u00a0K (5,505\u00a0\u00b0C; 9,941\u00a0\u00b0F), and V that it, like most stars, is a main-sequence star.[59][95]\nThe solar constant is the amount of power that the Sun deposits per unit area that is directly exposed to sunlight. The solar constant is equal to approximately 1,368\u00a0W/m2 (watts per square meter) at a distance of one astronomical unit (AU) from the Sun (that is, at or near Earth's orbit).[96] Sunlight on the surface of Earth is attenuated by Earth's atmosphere, so that less power arrives at the surface (closer to 1,000\u00a0W/m2) in clear conditions when the Sun is near the zenith.[97] Sunlight at the top of Earth's atmosphere is composed (by total energy) of about 50% infrared light, 40% visible light, and 10% ultraviolet light.[98] The atmosphere in particular filters out over 70% of solar ultraviolet, especially at the shorter wavelengths.[99] Solar ultraviolet radiation ionizes Earth's dayside upper atmosphere, creating the electrically conducting ionosphere.[100]\n\nUltraviolet light from the Sun has antiseptic properties and can be used to sanitize tools and water. It also causes sunburn, and has other biological effects such as the production of vitamin D and sun tanning. It is also the main cause of skin cancer. Ultraviolet light is strongly attenuated by Earth's ozone layer, so that the amount of UV varies greatly with latitude and has been partially responsible for many biological adaptations, including variations in human skin color in different regions of the Earth.[101]Once outside the Sun's surface, neutrinos and photons travel at the speed of light.High-energy gamma ray photons initially released with fusion reactions in the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, it takes a long time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000\u00a0years.[102] In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.[103]\nNeutrinos are also released by fusion reactions in the core, but, unlike photons, they rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately. For many years, measurements of the number of neutrinos produced in the Sun were lower than theories predicted by a factor of 3. This discrepancy was resolved in 2001 through the discovery of the effects of neutrino oscillation: the Sun emits the number of neutrinos predicted by the theory, but neutrino detectors were missing 2\u20443 of them because the neutrinos had changed flavor by the time they were detected.[104]\n\nMagnetic activity\nThe Sun has a stellar magnetic field that varies across its surface. Its polar field is 1\u20132 gauss (0.0001\u20130.0002\u00a0T), whereas the field is typically 3,000 gauss (0.3\u00a0T) in features on the Sun called sunspots and 10\u2013100 gauss (0.001\u20130.01\u00a0T) in solar prominences.[5] The magnetic field varies in time and location. The quasi-periodic 11-year solar cycle is the most prominent variation in which the number and size of sunspots waxes and wanes.[105][106][107]\nThe solar magnetic field extends well beyond the Sun itself. The electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's magnetic field into space, forming what is called the interplanetary magnetic field.[81] In an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics, plasma particles only move along magnetic field lines. As a result, the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward, forcing it into a roughly radial structure. For a simple dipolar solar magnetic field, with opposite hemispherical polarities on either side of the solar magnetic equator, a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind.[81]\nAt great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an Archimedean spiral structure called the Parker spiral.[81] The interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field. The Sun's dipole magnetic field of 50\u2013400\u00a0\u03bcT (at the photosphere) reduces with the inverse-cube of the distance, leading to a predicted magnetic field of 0.1\u00a0nT at the distance of Earth. However, according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at Earth's location is around 5\u00a0nT, about a hundred\u00a0times greater.[108] The difference is due to magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the Sun.\n\nSunspot\nMain article: Sunspot\nSunspots time-lapse in Hydrogen-alpha captured with an amateur solar telescope\nSunspots are visible as dark patches on the Sun's photosphere and correspond to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so they appear dark. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none can be seen at all. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum, sunspots tend to form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as Sp\u00f6rer's law. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.[109]\nAn 11-year sunspot cycle is half of a 22-year Babcock\u2013Leighton dynamo cycle, which corresponds to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At this point in the dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of the toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east\u2013west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon described by Hale's law.[110][111]\n\t\nDuring the solar cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the internal toroidal magnetic field to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With the rise of the next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.[112][113]\n\nSolar activity\nMain article: Solar cycle\nMeasurements from 2005 of solar cycle variation during the previous 30 years\nThe Sun's magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity. Solar flares and coronal-mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface. Both coronal-mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and the interplanetary magnetic field outward into the Solar System.[114] The effects of solar activity on Earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and the disruption of radio communications and electric power. Solar activity is thought to have played a large role in the formation and evolution of the Solar System.\nLong-term secular change in sunspot number is thought, by some scientists, to be correlated with long-term change in solar irradiance,[115] which, in turn, might influence Earth's long-term climate.[116] The solar cycle influences space weather conditions, including those surrounding Earth. For example, in the 17th century, the solar cycle appeared to have stopped entirely for several decades; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder minimum. This coincided in time with the era of the Little Ice Age, when Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures.[117] Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.[118]\nIn December 2019, a new type of solar magnetic explosion was observed, known as forced magnetic reconnection. Previously, in a process called spontaneous magnetic reconnection, it was observed that the solar magnetic field lines diverge explosively and then converge again instantaneously. Forced Magnetic Reconnection was similar, but it was triggered by an explosion in the corona.[119]\n\nLife phases\nMain articles: Formation and evolution of the Solar System and Stellar evolution\nOverview of the evolution of a star like the Sun\nThe Sun today is roughly halfway through the most stable part of its life. It has not changed dramatically in over four billion[a] years and will remain fairly stable for about than five billion more. However, after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo dramatic changes, both internally and externally. It is more massive than 71 of 75 other stars within 5 pc,[120] or in the top ~5 percent.\n\nFormation\nFurther information: Formation and evolution of the Solar System\nThe Sun formed about 4.6\u00a0billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars.[121] This age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology.[13] The result is consistent with the radiometric date of the oldest Solar System material, at 4.567\u00a0billion years ago.[122][123] Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that form only in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed. A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity.[124] As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate due to conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure.[125] Much of the mass became concentrated in the center, whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies.[126][127] Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accumulated more matter from the surrounding disk, eventually triggering nuclear fusion.[128]\nThe stars HD 162826 and HD 186302 share similarities with the Sun and are thus hypothesized to be its stellar siblings, formed in the same molecular cloud.[129][130]\n\nMain sequence\nEvolution of a Sun-like star. The track of a one solar mass star on the Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram is shown from the main sequence to the post-asymptotic-giant-branch stage.\nThe Sun is about halfway through its main-sequence stage, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 to 11 \u00a0billion years as a main-sequence star before the red giant phase of the Sun.[131] At the 8 billion year mark, the Sun will be at its hottest point according to the ESA's Gaia space observatory mission in 2022.[132]\nThe Sun is gradually becoming hotter in its core, hotter at the surface, larger in radius, and more luminous during its time on the main sequence: since the beginning of its main sequence life, it has expanded in radius by 15% and the surface has increased in temperature from 5,620\u00a0K (5,350\u00a0\u00b0C; 9,660\u00a0\u00b0F) to 5,777\u00a0K (5,504\u00a0\u00b0C; 9,939\u00a0\u00b0F), resulting in a 48% increase in luminosity from 0.677 solar luminosities to its present-day 1.0 solar luminosity. This occurs because the helium atoms in the core have a higher mean molecular weight than the hydrogen atoms that were fused, resulting in less thermal pressure. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the center, releasing gravitational potential energy. According to the virial theorem, half of this released gravitational energy goes into heating, which leads to a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs and thus an increase in the luminosity. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser.[133] At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100\u00a0million years. It will take at least 1 billion years from now to deplete liquid water from the Earth from such increase.[134] After that, the Earth will cease to be able to support complex, multicellular life and the last remaining multicellular organisms on the planet will suffer a final, complete mass extinction.[135]\n\nAfter core hydrogen exhaustion\nThe size of the current Sun (now in the main sequence) compared to its estimated size during its red-giant phase in the future\nThe Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a supernova. Instead, when it runs out of hydrogen in the core in approximately 5\u00a0billion years, core hydrogen fusion will stop, and there will be nothing to prevent the core from contracting. The release of gravitational potential energy will cause the luminosity of the Sun to increase, ending the main sequence phase and leading the Sun to expand over the next billion years: first into a subgiant, and then into a red giant.[133][136][137] The heating due to gravitational contraction will also lead to expansion of the Sun and hydrogen fusion in a shell just outside the core, where unfused hydrogen remains, contributing to the increased luminosity, which will eventually reach more than 1,000 times its present luminosity.[133] When the Sun enters its red-giant branch (RGB) phase, it will engulf Mercury and (likely) Venus, reaching about 0.75\u00a0AU (110\u00a0million\u00a0km; 70\u00a0million\u00a0mi).[137][138] The Sun will spend around a billion years in the RGB and lose around a third of its mass.[137]\nAfter the red-giant branch, the Sun has approximately 120\u00a0million years of active life left, but much happens. First, the core (full of degenerate helium) ignites violently in the helium flash; it is estimated that 6% of the core\u2014itself 40% of the Sun's mass\u2014will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple-alpha process.[139] The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity, with a temperature a little lower than today. It will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch, but a star of the Sun's metallicity does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch. Instead, it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100\u00a0million years as it continues to react helium in the core.[137]\nWhen the helium is exhausted, the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted. This time, however, it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous, engulfing Venus if it has not already. This is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, and the Sun is alternately reacting hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20\u00a0million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1\u00a0AU (150\u00a0million\u00a0km; 93\u00a0million\u00a0mi).[140]\nAccording to a 2008 model, Earth's orbit will have initially expanded to at most 1.5\u00a0AU (220\u00a0million\u00a0km; 140\u00a0million\u00a0mi) due to the Sun's loss of mass as a red giant. However, Earth's orbit will later start shrinking due to tidal forces (and, eventually, drag from the lower chromosphere) so that it is engulfed by the Sun during the tip of the red-giant branch phase, 3.8 and 1\u00a0million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate. Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss. Models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller, less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius.[137] For the Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula. By the end of that phase\u2014lasting approximately 500,000 years\u2014the Sun will only have about half of its current mass.\nThe post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolution is even faster. The luminosity stays approximately constant as the temperature increases, with the ejected half of the Sun's mass becoming ionized into a planetary nebula as the exposed core reaches 30,000\u00a0K (29,700\u00a0\u00b0C; 53,500\u00a0\u00b0F), as if it is in a sort of blue loop. The final naked core, a white dwarf, will have a temperature of over 100,000\u00a0K (100,000\u00a0\u00b0C; 180,000\u00a0\u00b0F), and contain an estimated 54.05% of the Sun's present-day mass.[137] The planetary nebula will disperse in about 10,000 years, but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical super-dense black dwarf.[141][142] As such it would give off no more energy for an even longer time than it was a white dwarf.[143]\n\nLocation\nSolar System\nMain article: Solar System\nThe Solar System, with sizes of the Sun and planets to scale. The terrestrial planets are on the right, the gas and ice giants are on the left.\nThe Sun has eight known planets orbiting it. This includes four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars), two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The Solar System also has nine bodies generally considered as dwarf planets and some more candidates, an asteroid belt, numerous comets, and a large number of icy bodies which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Six of the planets and many smaller bodies also have their own natural satellites: in particular, the satellite systems of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are in some ways like miniature versions of the Sun's system.[144]\nThe Sun is moved by the gravitational pull of the planets. The center of the Sun is always within 2.2 solar radii of the barycenter. This motion of the Sun is mainly due to the four large planets. Each planet in the series Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus has about twice as much effect (moment of inertia) as the next. For some periods of several decades (when Neptune and Uranus are in opposition) the motion is rather regular, forming a trefoil pattern, whereas between these periods it appears more chaotic.[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed][145] After 179 years (nine times the synodic period of Jupiter and Saturn), the pattern more or less repeats, but rotates by about 24\u00b0.[146] The orbits of the inner planets, including those of the Earth, are similarly displaced by the same gravitational forces, so the movement of the Sun has little effect on the relative positions of the Earth and the Sun or on solar irradiance on the Earth as a function of time.[147]\n\nCelestial neighborhood\nThis section is an excerpt from Solar System \u00a7 Celestial neighborhood.[edit]\nDiagram of the Local Interstellar Cloud, the G-Cloud and surrounding stars. As of 2022, the precise location of the Solar System in the clouds is an open question in astronomy.[148]\nThe Solar System is surrounded by the Local Interstellar Cloud, although it is not clear if it is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud or if it lies just outside the cloud's edge.[149][150] Multiple other interstellar clouds also exist in the region within 300 light-years of the Sun, known as the Local Bubble.[150] The latter feature is an hourglass-shaped cavity or superbubble in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, suggesting that it may be the product of several recent supernovae.[151]\nThe Local Bubble is a small superbubble compared to the neighboring wider Radcliffe Wave and Split linear structures (formerly Gould Belt), each of which are some thousands of light-years in length.[152] All these structures are part of the Orion Arm, which contains most of the stars in the Milky Way that are visible to the unaided eye. The density of all matter in the local neighborhood is 0.097\u00b10.013\u00a0M\u2609\u00b7pc\u22123.[153]\nWithin ten light-years of the Sun there are relatively few stars, the closest being the triple star system Alpha Centauri, which is about 4.4 light-years away and may be in the Local Bubble's G-Cloud.[154] Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the closest star to Earth, the small red dwarf Proxima Centauri, orbits the pair at a distance of 0.2 light-year. In 2016, a potentially habitable exoplanet was found to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called Proxima Centauri b, the closest confirmed exoplanet to the Sun.[155]\nThe next closest known fusors to the Sun are the red dwarfs Barnard's Star (at 5.9\u00a0ly), Wolf 359 (7.8\u00a0ly), and Lalande 21185 (8.3\u00a0ly).[156] The nearest brown dwarfs belong to the binary Luhman 16 system (6.6\u00a0ly), and the closest known rogue or free-floating planetary-mass object at less than 10 Jupiter masses is the sub-brown dwarf WISE 0855\u22120714 (7.4\u00a0ly).[157]\nJust beyond at 8.6\u00a0ly lies Sirius, the brightest star in Earth's night sky, with roughly twice the Sun's mass, orbited by the closest white dwarf to Earth, Sirius B. Other stars within ten light-years are the binary red-dwarf system Gliese 65 (8.7\u00a0ly) and the solitary red dwarf Ross 154 (9.7\u00a0ly).[158][159] The closest solitary Sun-like star to the Solar System is Tau Ceti at 11.9 light-years. It has roughly 80% of the Sun's mass but only about half of its luminosity.[160]\n\nThe nearest and unaided-visible group of stars beyond the immediate celestial neighborhood is the Ursa Major moving group at roughly 80 light-years, which is within the Local Bubble, like the nearest as well as unaided-visible star cluster the Hyades, which lie at its edge. The closest star-forming regions are the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex and the Taurus molecular cloud; the latter lies just beyond the Local Bubble and is part of the Radcliffe wave.[161]\nMotion\nFurther information: Stellar kinematics\nThe general motion and orientation of the Sun, and Earth and the Moon as its Solar System satellites.\nBeing part of the Milky Way galaxy the Sun, taking along the whole Solar System, moves in an orbital fashion around the galaxy's center of mass at an average speed of 230\u00a0km/s (828,000\u00a0km/h) or 143\u00a0mi/s (514,000\u00a0mph),[162] taking about 220-250 million Earth years to complete a revolution (a Galactic year),[163] having done so about 20 times since the Sun's formation.[164] The direction of the Sun's motion, the Solar apex is roughly in the direction of the star Vega.\n\nThe Sun's idealized orbit around the Galactic Center in an artist's top-down depiction of the current layout of the Milky Way.\nObservational history\nEarly understanding\nSee also: The Sun in culture\nThe Trundholm sun chariot pulled by a horse is a sculpture believed to be illustrating an important part of Nordic Bronze Age mythology.\nThe Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures throughout human history. Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the sky, whose presence above the horizon causes day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun was thought to be a solar deity or other supernatural entity. The Sun has played an important part in many world religions, as described in a later section.\nIn the early first millennium BC, Babylonian astronomers observed that the Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though they did not know why; it is today known that this is due to the movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.[165]\nOne of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the Sun was the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras. He reasoned that it was not the chariot of Helios, but instead a giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the land of the Peloponnesus and that the Moon reflected the light of the Sun.[166] For teaching this heresy, he was imprisoned by the authorities and sentenced to death, though he was later released through the intervention of Pericles. Eratosthenes estimated the distance between Earth and the Sun in the third century BC as \"of stadia myriads 400 and 80000\", the translation of which is ambiguous, implying either 4,080,000 stadia (755,000\u00a0km) or 804,000,000 stadia (148 to 153\u00a0million kilometers or 0.99 to 1.02 AU); the latter value is correct to within a few percent. In the first century AD, Ptolemy estimated the distance as 1,210 times the radius of Earth, approximately 7.71\u00a0million kilometers (0.0515\u00a0AU).[167]\nThe theory that the Sun is the center around which the planets orbit was first proposed by the ancient Greek Aristarchus of Samos in the third century BC, and later adopted by Seleucus of Seleucia (see Heliocentrism). This view was developed in a more detailed mathematical model of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by Nicolaus Copernicus.\n\nDevelopment of scientific understanding\nObservations of sunspots were recorded during the Han Dynasty (206 BC\u2013AD 220) by Chinese astronomers, who maintained records of these observations for centuries. Averroes also provided a description of sunspots in the 12th century.[168] The invention of the telescope in the early 17th century permitted detailed observations of sunspots by Thomas Harriot, Galileo Galilei and other astronomers. Galileo posited that sunspots were on the surface of the Sun rather than small objects passing between Earth and the Sun.[169]\nArabic astronomical contributions include Al-Battani's discovery that the direction of the Sun's apogee (the place in the Sun's orbit against the fixed stars where it seems to be moving slowest) is changing.[170] (In modern heliocentric terms, this is caused by a gradual motion of the aphelion of the Earth's orbit). Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe.[171]\n\nSol, the Sun, from a 1550 edition of Guido Bonatti's Liber astronomiae\nFrom an observation of a transit of Venus in 1032, the Persian astronomer and polymath Ibn Sina concluded that Venus was closer to Earth than the Sun.[172] In 1672 Giovanni Cassini and Jean Richer determined the distance to Mars and were thereby able to calculate the distance to the Sun.\nIn 1666, Isaac Newton observed the Sun's light using a prism, and showed that it is made up of light of many colors.[173] In 1800, William Herschel discovered infrared radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum.[174] The 19th century saw advancement in spectroscopic studies of the Sun; Joseph von Fraunhofer recorded more than 600 absorption lines in the spectrum, the strongest of which are still often referred to as Fraunhofer lines. The 20th century brought about several specialized systems for observing the Sun, especially at different narrowband wavelengths, such as those using Calcium H (396.9\u00a0nm), K (393.37\u00a0nm) and Hydrogen-alpha (656.46\u00a0nm) filtering.\n\nSun as seen in Hydrogen-alpha light\nIn the early years of the modern scientific era, the source of the Sun's energy was a significant puzzle. Lord Kelvin suggested that the Sun is a gradually cooling liquid body that is radiating an internal store of heat.[175] Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz then proposed a gravitational contraction mechanism to explain the energy output, but the resulting age estimate was only 20\u00a0million years, well short of the time span of at least 300\u00a0million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time.[175][176] In 1890 Joseph Lockyer, who discovered helium in the solar spectrum, proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the Sun.[177]\nNot until 1904 was a documented solution offered. Ernest Rutherford suggested that the Sun's output could be maintained by an internal source of heat, and suggested radioactive decay as the source.[178] However, it would be Albert Einstein who would provide the essential clue to the source of the Sun's energy output with his mass\u2013energy equivalence relation E = mc2.[179] In 1920, Sir Arthur Eddington proposed that the pressures and temperatures at the core of the Sun could produce a nuclear fusion reaction that merged hydrogen (protons) into helium nuclei, resulting in a production of energy from the net change in mass.[180] The preponderance of hydrogen in the Sun was confirmed in 1925 by Cecilia Payne using the ionization theory developed by Meghnad Saha. The theoretical concept of fusion was developed in the 1930s by the astrophysicists Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Hans Bethe. Hans Bethe calculated the details of the two main energy-producing nuclear reactions that power the Sun.[181][182] In 1957, Margaret Burbidge, Geoffrey Burbidge, William Fowler and Fred Hoyle showed that most of the elements in the universe have been synthesized by nuclear reactions inside stars, some like the Sun.[183]\n\nSolar space missions\nSee also: Solar observatory\nIllustration of Pioneer 6, 7, 8, and 9\nThe first satellites designed for long term observation of the Sun from interplanetary space were NASA's Pioneers 6, 7, 8 and 9, which were launched between 1959 and 1968. These probes orbited the Sun at a distance similar to that of Earth, and made the first detailed measurements of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field. Pioneer 9 operated for a particularly long time, transmitting data until May 1983.[184][185]\nIn the 1970s, two Helios spacecraft and the Skylab Apollo Telescope Mount provided scientists with significant new data on solar wind and the solar corona. The Helios 1 and 2 probes were U.S.\u2013German collaborations that studied the solar wind from an orbit carrying the spacecraft inside Mercury's orbit at perihelion.[186] The Skylab space station, launched by NASA in 1973, included a solar observatory module called the Apollo Telescope Mount that was operated by astronauts resident on the station.[80] Skylab made the first time-resolved observations of the solar transition region and of ultraviolet emissions from the solar corona.[80] Discoveries included the first observations of coronal mass ejections, then called \"coronal transients\", and of coronal holes, now known to be intimately associated with the solar wind.[186]\nIn the 1970s, much research focused on the abundances of iron-group elements in the Sun.[187][188] Although significant research was done, until 1978 it was difficult to determine the abundances of some iron-group elements (e.g. cobalt and manganese) via spectrography because of their hyperfine structures.[187] The first largely complete set of oscillator strengths of singly ionized iron-group elements were made available in the 1960s,[189] and these were subsequently improved.[190] In 1978, the abundances of singly ionized elements of the iron group were derived.[187]\nVarious authors have considered the existence of a gradient in the isotopic compositions of solar and planetary noble gases,[191] e.g. correlations between isotopic compositions of neon and xenon in the Sun and on the planets.[192] Prior to 1983, it was thought that the whole Sun has the same composition as the solar atmosphere.[193] In 1983, it was claimed that it was fractionation in the Sun itself that caused the isotopic-composition relationship between the planetary and solar-wind-implanted noble gases.[193]\n\nDrawing of a Solar Maximum Mission probe\nIn 1980, the Solar Maximum Mission probes were launched by NASA. This spacecraft was designed to observe gamma rays, X-rays and UV radiation from solar flares during a time of high solar activity and solar luminosity. Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive state. In 1984, Space Shuttle Challenger mission STS-41C retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit. The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the solar corona before re-entering Earth's atmosphere in June 1989.[194]\nLaunched in 1991, Japan's Yohkoh (Sunbeam) satellite observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed scientists to identify several different types of flares and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an annular eclipse in 2001 caused it to lose its lock on the Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.[195]\nOne of the most important solar missions to date has been the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA and launched on 2 December 1995.[80] Originally intended to serve a two-year mission, a mission extension through 2012 was approved in October 2009.[196] It has proven so useful that a follow-on mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory, was launched in February 2010.[197] Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch.[80] Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery of a large number of comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun.[198]\n\nUlysses spacecraft testing at the vacuum spin-balancing facility\nArtist rendition of the Parker Solar Probe\nAll these satellites have observed the Sun from the plane of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. The Ulysses probe was launched in 1990 to study the Sun's polar regions. It first traveled to Jupiter, to \"slingshot\" into an orbit that would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic. Once Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750\u00a0km/s, which was slower than expected, and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes that scattered galactic cosmic rays.[199]\nElemental abundances in the photosphere are well known from spectroscopic studies, but the composition of the interior of the Sun is more poorly understood. A solar wind sample return mission, Genesis, was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material.[200]\n\nSolar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission was launched in October 2006. Two identical spacecraft were launched into orbits that caused them to (respectively) pull further ahead of and fall gradually behind Earth. This enables stereoscopic imaging of the Sun and solar phenomena, such as coronal mass ejections.[201][202]\nParker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 aboard a Delta IV Heavy rocket and will reach a perihelion of 0.046\u00a0AU in 2025, making it the closest-orbiting manmade satellite as the first spacecraft to fly low into the solar corona.[203]\nSolar Orbiter mission (SolO) was launched in 2020 and will reach a minimum perihelion of 0.28 AU, making it the closest satellite with sun-facing cameras.[204]\nCubeSat for Solar Particles (CuSP) was launched as a rideshare on Artemis 1 on 16 November 2022 to study particles and magnetic fields.\nIndian Space Research Organisation has launched a 100\u00a0kg satellite named Aditya-L1 on 2 September 2023.[205] Its main instrument will be a coronagraph for studying the dynamics of the solar corona.[206]\nUnsolved problems\nCoronal heating\nMain article: Stellar corona\n\n\nUnsolved problem in astronomy:\nWhy is the Sun's corona so much hotter than the Sun's surface?\n(more unsolved problems in astronomy)\n\nThe temperature of the photosphere is approximately 6,000\u00a0K, whereas the temperature of the corona reaches 1,000,000\u20132,000,000\u00a0K.[79] The high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat conduction from the photosphere.[81]\nIt is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating.[79] The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone.[79] These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient matter in the form of heat.[207] The other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events\u2014nanoflares.[208]\nCurrently, it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism. All waves except Alfv\u00e9n waves have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona.[209] In addition, Alfv\u00e9n waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.[79]\n\nFaint young Sun\nMain article: Faint young Sun paradox\n\n\nUnsolved problem in astronomy:\nHow could the early Earth have had liquid water if the Sun's output is predicted to have only been 70% as intense as it is today?\n(more unsolved problems in astronomy)\n\nTheoretical models of the Sun's development suggest that 3.8 to 2.5\u00a0billion years ago, during the Archean eon, the Sun was only about 75% as bright as it is today. Such a weak star would not have been able to sustain liquid water on Earth's surface, and thus life should not have been able to develop. However, the geological record demonstrates that Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today. One theory among scientists is that the atmosphere of the young Earth contained much larger quantities of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of solar energy reaching it.[210]\nHowever, examination of Archaean sediments appears inconsistent with the hypothesis of high greenhouse concentrations. Instead, the moderate temperature range may be explained by a lower surface albedo brought about by less continental area and the lack of biologically induced cloud condensation nuclei. This would have led to increased absorption of solar energy, thereby compensating for the lower solar output.[211]\n\nObservation by eyes\nThe Sun seen from Earth, with glare from the lenses. The eye also sees glare when looked towards the Sun directly.\nThe brightness of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes.[212][213] Looking directly at the Sun (sungazing) causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4\u00a0milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness.[214][215] Viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina beginning after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused.[216][217]\nViewing the Sun through light-concentrating optics such as binoculars may result in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter that blocks UV and substantially dims the sunlight. When using an attenuating filter to view the Sun, the viewer is cautioned to use a filter specifically designed for that use. Some improvised filters that pass UV or IR rays, can actually harm the eye at high brightness levels.[218] Brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.[219]\nDuring sunrise and sunset, sunlight is attenuated because of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere,[220] and the Sun is sometimes faint enough to be viewed comfortably with the naked eye or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.[221]\nAn optical phenomenon, known as a green flash, can sometimes be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.[222]\n\nReligious aspects\nMain article: Solar deity\nSun and Immortal Birds Gold Ornament by ancient Shu people. The center is a sun pattern with twelve points around which four birds fly in the same counterclockwise direction. Ancient Kingdom of Shu, coinciding with the Shang dynasty.\nSolar deities play a major role in many world religions and mythologies.[223] Worship of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians, the Inca of South America and the Aztecs of what is now Mexico. In religions such as Hinduism, the Sun is still considered a god, known as Surya. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice (for example in Nabta Playa, Egypt; Mnajdra, Malta; and Stonehenge, England); Newgrange, a prehistoric human-built mount in Ireland, was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of El Castillo at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.\nThe ancient Sumerians believed that the Sun was Utu,[224][225] the god of justice and twin brother of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven,[224] who was identified as the planet Venus.[225] Later, Utu was identified with the East Semitic god Shamash.[224][225] Utu was regarded as a helper-deity, who aided those in distress.[224]\n\nRa from the tomb of Nefertari, 13th\u00a0century\u00a0BC\nFrom at least the Fourth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the Sun was worshipped as the god Ra, portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk, and surrounded by a serpent. In the New Empire period, the Sun became identified with the dung beetle. In the form of the sun disc Aten, the Sun had a brief resurgence during the Amarna Period when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the Pharaoh Akhenaton.[226][227]Ra on the solar barque, adorned with the sun-diskThe Egyptians portrayed the god Ra as being carried across the sky in a solar barque, accompanied by lesser gods, and to the Greeks, he was Helios, carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses. From the reign of Elagabalus in the late Roman Empire the Sun's birthday was a holiday celebrated as Sol Invictus (literally \"Unconquered Sun\") soon after the winter solstice, which may have been an antecedent to Christmas. Regarding the fixed stars, the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the ecliptic through the zodiac, and so Greek astronomers categorized it as one of the seven planets (Greek planetes, \"wanderer\"); the naming of the days of the weeks after the seven planets dates to the Roman era.[228][229][230]\nIn Proto-Indo-European religion, the Sun was personified as the goddess *Seh2ul.[231][232] Derivatives of this goddess in Indo-European languages include the Old Norse S\u00f3l, Sanskrit Surya, Gaulish Sulis, Lithuanian Saul\u0117, and Slavic Solntse.[232] In ancient Greek religion, the sun deity was the male god Helios,[233] who in later times was syncretized with Apollo.[234]\nIn the Bible, Malachi 4:2 mentions the \"Sun of Righteousness\" (sometimes translated as the \"Sun of Justice\"),[235][236] which some Christians have interpreted as a reference to the Messiah (Christ).[237] In ancient Roman culture, Sunday was the day of the sun god. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed. The celebration of the winter solstice (which influenced Christmas) was part of the Roman cult of the unconquered Sun (Sol Invictus). It was adopted as the Sabbath day by Christians. The symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by Christians, and perhaps the most important one that did not come from Jewish traditions. Christian churches were built so that the congregation faced toward the sunrise.[238]\nTonatiuh, the Aztec god of the sun,[239] was closely associated with the practice of human sacrifice.[239] The sun goddess Amaterasu is the most important deity in the Shinto religion,[240][241] and she is believed to be the direct ancestor of all Japanese emperors.[240]\n\nSee also\n\nAstronomy portalStars portalSolar System portalWeather portalPhysics portal\n\nAdvanced Composition Explorer\u00a0\u2013 NASA satellite of the Explorer program, at SE-L1, studying solar wind etc\nAnalemma\u00a0\u2013 Diagrammatic representation of Sun's position over a period of time\nAntisolar point\u00a0\u2013 Point on the celestial sphere opposite Sun\nCircled dot\u00a0\u2013  other uses of the Sun symbol and similar symbols\nList of brightest stars\u00a0\u2013 Stars sorted by apparent magnitude\nList of nearest stars and brown dwarfs\u00a0\u2013 Stars and brown dwarfs within 20 light years of the Solar System\nMidnight sun\u00a0\u2013 Natural phenomenon when daylight lasts for a whole day\nPlanets in astrology \u00a7\u00a0Sun\nSolar telescope\u00a0\u2013 Telescope used to observe the Sun\nSun path\u00a0\u2013 Arc-like path that the Sun appears to follow across the sky\nSun-Earth Day\u00a0\u2013 NASA and ESA joint educational program\nTimeline of the far future\u00a0\u2013 Scientific projections regarding the far future\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n^ a b All numbers in this article are short scale.

Owned by Gray Television, the station maintains studios on Northwest 43rd Street in Gainesville, and its transmitter is located near Micanopy, Florida.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nWCJB began broadcasting April 7, 1971, as an NBC affiliate owned by William E. \"Bill\" Minshall. Originally broadcasting an analog signal on UHF channel 20, its call sign bears the first initials of his family members: Casey (daughter), JoAnn (wife), and himself, Bill. In 1973, just two years after its first broadcast, the station switched its affiliation to ABC.[2] In 1976, WCJB was sold to Diversified Communications. In 2001, it began airing its digital signal on UHF channel 16. WCJB was one of the ABC affiliates that aired Saving Private Ryan in 2004.  \nOn September 18, 2006, WCJB launched a new second digital subchannel to be the area's The CW affiliate as part of the national CW Plus service, replacing the cable-only WB 100+ affiliate \"WBFL\" after the WB-UPN merger.\nIts coverage area includes Lake City (within the Jacksonville market), Ocala (in the Orlando market) and most of North Central Florida. It is also the sole ABC affiliate on cable systems in Live Oak and Jasper (both within the Tallahassee area). Until July 2006, WCJB was the only ABC affiliate seen on Cox systems in Ocala. Even though that city is part of the Orlando market, this station had exclusivity on that system for ABC programming. This kept in-market affiliate WFTV off the system for several years. In that month, the cable company received the green light to pick up WFTV's standard and high definition feeds in Ocala. WFTV and WCJB are also both seen on Charter Spectrum in Belleview and unincorporated Marion County.\nDiversified announced on February 16, 2017, that it would exit broadcasting and sell WCJB and its sister station WABI-TV in Bangor, Maine to Gray Television for $85 million.[3] The sale was completed on May 1, 2017.[4] It made WCJB a sister station to WCTV (Gray Television's then-flagship station) in Tallahassee and WJHG-TV and WECP-LD in Panama City.\n\nProgramming[edit]\nSports programming[edit]\nWCJB airs select Florida Gators football games as part of ABC's rights to college football telecasts. The station aired the Gators' first-ever national championship in 1996 through their victory in the 1997 Sugar Bowl.\n\nNews operation[edit]\nAs of September 2022, WCJB presently broadcasts 35 hours, 15 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6 hours, 35 minutes each weekday and an hour each on Saturdays and Sundays). The station also broadcasts 2+1\u20442 hours of late local news each week on its WCJB-DT2 CW subchannel.\nOriginally, WCJB was the only station to operate a news department covering the Gainesville area. As a result, it held the number one spot in Nielsen ratings by a wide margin for most of the station's existence. In addition to its main studios, this station operates a Marion County Bureau on Northeast 1st Avenue in Ocala.\nUntil the establishment of rival WGFL's GTN News in 2010 (later CBS 4 News), WCJB had the only local news department on a commercial station \u2013 non-commercial WUFT television airs a nightly newscast produced by University of Florida journalism and broadcasting students; and Fox affiliate WOGX simulcasts newscasts from sister station WOFL in Orlando, with no separate local inserts targeted to the Gainesville area. Following the discontinuation of CBS 4 News on May 12, 2023, WCJB reassumed becoming the only commercial news station serving Gainesville.\nOn April 19, 2009, WCJB debuted a new set complete with updated graphics and music theme (identical to that of Des Moines CBS affiliate KCCI in the late '90s) which had not changed in almost ten years. The graphics are yellow and orange instead of blue and white. Its updated logo now includes ABC in it unlike the previous two. WCJB began airing local newscasts in high definition on January 9, 2010. Its music theme was later updated in 2012, with a background graphics color change to blue and red. The music theme and news set was then modified on October 22, 2015, and the background graphics was updated on February 1, 2016, showing photos relating to Gainesville and North Central Florida.\nFrom September 18, 2006, until February 2010, it produced a half-hour weeknight prime time newscast on WCJB-DT2, titled WCJB-TV 20 News at 10 on Gainesville CW. The live broadcast was dropped in favor of a repeat of the main channel's 6 o'clock show, but the repeat was later dropped as well.\nOn January 18, 2016, WCJB expanded its early evening newscast a half-hour earlier to 5:00\u00a0p.m. instead of 5:30.[5] The 6:00\u00a0p.m. newscast remains as scheduled.\nOn June 26, 2017, for the first time in over eight years, WCJB updated a new logo.\nOn September 6, 2021, WCJB added an hour-long weekday 4:00\u00a0p.m. newscast on the main channel and relaunched a half-hour 10:00\u00a0p.m. newscast on the DT2 CW subchannel.[6]\nOn September 5, 2022, WCJB extended its weekday noon newscast to one hour,[7] with the last half-hour replacing the canceled Right This Minute.\n\nFlorida\u2013Dayton recreation[edit]\nOn March 29, 2014, the Florida Gators beat the Dayton Flyers 62\u201352 in the Elite Eight of the NCAA basketball tournament. Since WCJB is an ABC affiliate and CBS owned the broadcast rights (although the game aired nationally on TBS), the network could not show highlights until the day after per NCAA regulations. The news team instead recreated the highlights inside a conference room at the station's studios, using a mini-hoop attached to the wall and the station staff doubling as players.[8]\n\nTechnical information[edit]\nSubchannels[edit]\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\n\nSubchannels of WCJB-TV[9]\n\n\nChannel\n\nRes.\n\nAspect\n\nShort name\n\nProgramming\n\n\n20.1\n\n720p\n16:9\nWCJBabc\nMain WCJB-TV programming / ABC\n\n\n20.2\n\nWCJB-CW\nGainesville CW\n\n\n20.3\n\n480i\nMeTV\nMeTV\n\n\n20.4\n\nCircle\nThe365\n\n\n20.5\n\nCrime\nTrue Crime Network\n\n\n20.6\n\nGrit\nGrit\n\nWCJB-DT2 upgraded its signal to 720p in June 2012.[10]\nIn January 2018, WCJB added MeTV to its subchannel lineup on channel 20.3, marking the first new subchannel added to WCJB since adding Gainesville CW  in September 2006. MeTV had been aired on NBC affiliate WNBW's subchannel 9.4 prior to the change.\nOn January 1, 2020, WCJB launched a new subchannel, Circle, on channel 20.4.\nIn March 2020, WCJB added another new subchannel, Justice Network (now True Crime Network), on channel 20.5.\nOn December 1, 2022, the station added a sixth subchannel, Grit.\n\nAnalog-to-digital conversion[edit]\nWCJB-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 20, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 16.[11] Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 20.\n\nFormer translator[edit]\nUntil 1998, WCJB operated an analog translator station, W57AN (UHF channel 57) which rebroadcast WCJB's signal into Marion County from a transmitter located on NE Jacksonville Rd in Ocala.[12][13]\n\nSee also[edit]\nChannel 16 digital TV stations in the United States\nChannel 20 virtual TV stations in the United States\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Facility Technical Data for WCJB-TV\".

    "wiki": "Natural submerged sandbank that rises from a body of water to near the surface\nThis article is about underwater landforms. For fish behavior, see Shoaling and schooling. For effects of shallow water on waves, see Wave shoaling. For other uses, see Shoal (disambiguation).\n\n\n\"Shoals\" and \"Sandbank\" redirect here. For other uses, see Shoals (disambiguation) and Sandbank (disambiguation).\nSandbar between St Agnes and Gugh on the Isles of Scilly, off the coast of Cornwall, England, United Kingdom\nA tidal sandbar connecting the islands of Waya and Wayasewa of the Yasawa Islands, Fiji\nSandbar between Nosy\u00a0Iranja\u00a0Be and Nosy\u00a0Iranja\u00a0Kely(Nosy Iranja, Madagascar)\nIn oceanography, geomorphology, and geoscience, a shoal is a natural submerged ridge, bank, or bar that consists of, or is covered by, sand or other unconsolidated material, and rises from the bed of a body of water close  to the surface or above it, which poses a danger to navigation. Shoals are also known as sandbanks, sandbars, or gravelbars. Two or more shoals that are either separated by shared troughs or interconnected by past or present sedimentary and hydrographic processes are referred to as a shoal complex.[1][2]\nThe term shoal is also used in a number of ways that can be either similar to, or quite different from, how it is used in geologic, geomorphic, and oceanographic literature. Sometimes, the term refers to either any relatively shallow place in a stream, lake, sea, or other body of water; a rocky area on the seafloor within an area mapped for navigation purposes; or, a growth of vegetation on the bottom of a deep lake, that occurs at any depth, or is used as a verb for the process of proceeding from a greater to a lesser depth of water.[2]\n\n\nDescription[edit]\nShoals are characteristically long and narrow (linear) ridges. They can develop where a stream, river, or ocean current promotes deposition of sediment and granular material, resulting in localized shallowing (shoaling) of the water. Marine shoals also develop either by the in-place drowning of barrier islands as the result of episodic sea level rise or by the erosion and submergence of inactive delta lobes.\nShoals can appear as a coastal landform in the sea, where they are classified as a type of ocean bank, or as fluvial landforms in rivers, streams, and lakes.\nA shoal\u2013sandbar may seasonally separate a smaller body of water from the sea, such as:\n\nMarine lagoons\nBrackish water estuaries\nFreshwater seasonal stream and river mouths and deltas.\nThe term bar can apply to landform features spanning a considerable range in size, from a length of a few meters in a small stream to marine depositions stretching for hundreds of kilometers along a coastline, often called barrier islands.\n\nComposition[edit]\nThey are typically composed of sand, although they could be of any granular matter that the moving water has access to and is capable of shifting around (for example, soil, silt, gravel, cobble, shingle, or even boulders). The grain size of the material comprising a bar is related to the size of the waves or the strength of the currents moving the material, but the availability of material to be worked by waves and currents is also important.\n\nFormation[edit]\nMain article: Wave shoaling\nWave shoaling is the process when surface waves move towards shallow water, such as a beach, they slow down, their wave height increases and the distance between waves decreases. This behavior is called shoaling, and the waves are said to shoal. The waves may or may not build to the point where they break, depending on how large they were to begin with, and how steep the slope of the beach is. In particular, waves shoal as they pass over submerged sandbanks or reefs. This can be treacherous for boats and ships.\nShoaling can also refract waves, so the waves change direction. For example, if waves pass over a sloping bank which is shallower at one end than the other, then the shoaling effect will result in the waves slowing more at the shallow end. Thus, the wave fronts will refract, changing direction like light passing through a prism. Refraction also occurs as waves move towards a beach if the waves come in at an angle to the beach, or if the beach slopes more gradually at one end than the other.\n\nTypes[edit]\nDonuzlav, Crimea, separated by a peresyp from the Black Sea\nSandbars and longshore bars[edit]\nAmanohashidate in Miyazu, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan\nWhite Island in Camiguin, Philippines\nA sandbar off Suffolk County, Long Island, New York, US, August 2006.\nSandbars, also known as a trough bars, form where the waves are breaking, because the breaking waves set up a shoreward current with a compensating counter-current along the bottom. Sometimes this occurs seaward of a trough (marine landform).\nSand carried by the offshore moving bottom current is deposited where the current reaches the wave break.[3] Other longshore bars may lie further offshore, representing the break point of even larger waves, or the break point at low tide.\n\nPeresyp[edit]\nMain article: Peresyp\nIn Russian tradition of geomorphology, a peresyp is a sandbar that rises above the water level (like a spit) and separates a liman or a lagoon from the sea. Unlike tombolo bars, a peresyp seldom forms a contiguous strip and usually has one or several channels that connect the liman and the sea.[4]\n\nHarbor and river bars[edit]\nFurther information: River bar and Mouth bar\nThe Doom Bar sand bank extends across the River Camel estuary in Cornwall, England, UK\nA harbor or river bar is a sedimentary deposit formed at a harbor entrance or river mouth by the deposition of freshwater sediment or by the action of waves on the sea floor or on up-current beaches.\nWhere beaches are suitably mobile, or the river's suspended or bed loads are large enough, deposition can build up a sandbar that completely blocks a river mouth and dams the river. It can be a seasonally natural process of aquatic ecology, causing the formation of estuaries and wetlands in the lower course of the river.  This situation will persist until the bar is eroded by the sea, or the dammed river develops sufficient head to break through the bar.\nThe formation of harbor bars that prevent access for boats and shipping can be the result of:\n\nconstruction up-coast or at the harbor \u2014 e.g.: breakwaters, dune habitat destruction.\nupriver development \u2014 e.g.: dams and reservoirs, riparian zone destruction, river bank alterations, river adjacent agricultural land practices, water diversions.\nwatershed erosion from habitat alterations  \u2014 e.g.: deforestation, wildfires, grading for development.\nartificially created/deepened harbors that require periodic dredging maintenance.\nNautical navigation[edit]\nIn a nautical sense, a bar is a shoal, similar to a reef: a shallow formation of (usually) sand that is a navigation or grounding hazard, with a depth of water of 6 fathoms (11 meters) or less. It therefore applies to a silt accumulation that shallows the entrance to or course of a river, or creek.  A bar can form a dangerous obstacle to shipping, preventing access to the river or harbor in poor weather conditions or at some states of the tide.\n\nGeological units[edit]\nShoals in the Mississippi River at Arkansas and Mississippi, USA.\nIn addition to longshore bars discussed above that are relatively small features of a beach, the term shoal can be applied to larger geological units that form off a coastline as part of the process of coastal erosion, such as spits and baymouth bars that form across the front of embayments and rias. A tombolo is a bar that forms an isthmus between an island or offshore rock and a mainland shore.\nIn places of reentrance along a coastline (such as inlets, coves, rias, and bays), sediments carried by a longshore current will fall out where the current dissipates, forming a spit.  An area of water isolated behind a large bar is called a lagoon. Over time, lagoons may silt up, becoming salt marshes.\nIn some cases, shoals may be precursors to beach expansion and dunes formation, providing a source of windblown sediment to augment such beach or dunes landforms.[5]\n\nHuman habitation[edit]\nSince prehistoric times, humans have chosen some shoals as a site of habitation. In some early cases, the locations provided easy access to exploit marine resources.[6] In modern times, these sites are sometimes chosen for the water amenity or view, but many such locations are prone to storm damage.[7][8]\nAn area in Northwest Alabama is commonly referred to as \u201cThe Shoals\u201d by local inhabitants, and one of the cities, Muscle Shoals, is named for such landform and its abundance of Mussels.\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Shoals.\n\nAyre (landform)\u00a0\u2013 Shingle beaches in Orkney and Shetland\nBarrier Island\u00a0\u2013 Coastal dune landform that forms by wave and tidal action parallel to the mainland coastPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nBank (geography)\u00a0\u2013 Land alongside a body of water\nCoastal Barrier Resources Act \u2014 1982 U.S. law\nReef\u00a0\u2013 A shoal of rock, coral or other sufficiently coherent material, lying beneath the surface of water\nTombolo\u00a0\u2013 Deposition landform in which an island is connected to the mainland by a sandy isthmus\nThe Point of Sangomar\u00a0\u2013 Sand spit located on the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the Saloum Delta\nAdam's Bridge\u00a0\u2013 Chain of shoals between India and Sri Lanka\nList of shoals and sandbanks in the southern North Sea\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Rutecki D, Nestler E, Dellapenna T, Pembroke A (2014). \"Understanding the Habitat Value and Function of Shoal/Ridge/Trough Complexes to Fish and Fisheries on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf\".

It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, which provides certain services to Dabl affiliate WRGT-TV (channel 45) under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Cunningham Broadcasting. However, Sinclair effectively owns WRGT-TV as the majority of Cunningham's stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith. The two stations share studios on Corporate Place in Miamisburg; WKEF's transmitter is located off South Gettysburg Avenue in southwest Dayton.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nEarly years[edit]\nChannel 22 first signed on in Dayton in October 1953 as WIFE (the call sign was to be WONE-TV, but was changed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in February 1953).[2] The station was owned by Skyland Broadcasting Corporation, then-owner of WONE (AM) radio.[3] Although the station first carried programming from ABC and DuMont,[4] the networks stopped providing programming and the station went dark around March 20, 1954.[5] In approximately February 1959, the FCC changed the call sign of the still-dark WIFE to the earlier-proposed WONE-TV.[6]\nIn March 1961, the owners of Skyland Broadcasting Corporation sold the construction permit for dark WONE-TV, as well as on-the-air then-sister stations WONE (AM) and WIFE (FM) (now WTUE), to Brush-Moore Newspapers.[7][8][9]\nFrom 1961 into 1963, WONE-TV (and other applicants) requested that the FCC assign a new channel 11 to Dayton; in WONE-TV's case, the plan was to move its license from channel 22 to channel 11. Objecting to this request were other stations in the region already broadcasting on channel 11\u2014WTOL in Toledo, WHAS-TV in Louisville and WIIC (now WPXI) in Pittsburgh\u2014as well as channel 12, WKRC-TV in Cincinnati; the stations claimed that interference from the proposed Dayton channel would disrupt reception for significant numbers of their stations' viewers. Although the FCC initially seemed in favor of adding VHF channels to existing television markets, it ultimately decided against most of them, including channel 11 for Dayton.[10][11][12][13][14]\nIn December 1963, Brush-Moore Newspapers sold the construction permit for still-dark WONE-TV to Springfield Television Corporation (owner of WWLP in Springfield, Massachusetts).[15][16] In January 1964 the station was renamed WKEF[17] after the maiden name, Kathryn Elizabeth Flynn, of Springfield Television Corporation owner William Lowell Putnam III's future wife (who also went by the names Kitty Broman and Kitty Broman Putnam).[18]\nSometime prior to February 18, 1963, Springfield Television asked that the FCC move channel 38 from Connersville, Indiana, to Dayton in lieu of the dark channel 22.[12] Conventional wisdom suggested that WKEF would take the ABC affiliation since it was Dayton's third commercial station. The actual initial sign-on for WKEF has been disputed: one unknown source stated that the station opened on August 22, 1964,[citation needed] while according to the Putnams' memoir, How We Survived in UHF Television, WKEF signed on in spring 1963.\nBefore 1964, ABC programming came to Dayton by way of off-hours clearances on NBC affiliate WLWD (channel 2, now WDTN). In addition, viewers could watch the full ABC schedule on WKRC-TV in Cincinnati and WTVN-TV (now WSYX) in Columbus, both of which decently covered Dayton. Under these circumstances, ABC initially balked at giving even a secondary affiliation to WKEF, forcing the station to make a go of it as an independent until late 1965. Another consideration may have been that many Dayton viewers did not have UHF-capable sets at the time. The FCC had just required television set manufacturers to include all-channel tuning months earlier.\nIn late 1965, ABC relented and gave WKEF the ABC affiliation, running ABC prime time shows and sports, plus any daytime shows that WKRC-TV or WTVN-TV preempted or WLWD (until 1971) did not carry. (From 1967 to 1971, independent station WKTR-TV channel 16 carried some ABC programs not cleared locally by WKEF.)\nFor many years, WKEF produced the daily children's program Clubhouse 22 hosted by Malcolm MacLeod in the early 1970s with Joe Smith taking over in the mid-1970s. Their cohorts included Duffy the Dog, Stan The Man, and later Dr. Creep (Barry Hobart). For a time, the theme song of the program was to the tune of \"High Hopes\" and included the lyrics \"Joe and Duff on Clubhouse 22!\" Later, the theme was to the tune of \"Mah N\u00e0 Mah N\u00e0,\" with the lyrics \"It's time for Malcolm / And Duffy, too.\" Dr. Creep was also the host of WKEF's weekly horror movie show, Shock Theater. Nationally syndicated conservative talk-show host Mike Gallagher began his broadcasting career at WKEF as a weatherman, sportscaster, and special events host.\nBy 1978, ABC had become the nation's most-watched network (with shows such as Happy Days) and was unhappy with the Cincinnati\u2013Dayton arrangement. WKRC-TV and WTVN-TV were both preempting decent amounts of the network's daytime programming, late night shows, and some of the Saturday morning cartoons. ABC wanted a station in Dayton that could run its whole schedule and be able to reach Cincinnati and Columbus. It also wanted a station that had local news. Although the station did eventually launch a full-scale news department in 1979, it was not enough to save its affiliation with ABC.\n\nSwitch to NBC[edit]\nIn late 1979, ABC began talks with WDTN, which provided at least grade B coverage from northern Kentucky all the way to Columbus. The two sides quickly reached a deal, which called for ABC to move its Dayton affiliation to WDTN when WKEF's contract ran out at the end of the year. The change took effect on New Year's Day 1980. Almost by default, WKEF was then left to take the NBC affiliation. At the time, NBC was far less tolerant of preemptions than the other two commercial networks, and was also in last place among the three networks. As a condition of signing up with NBC, WKEF was required to clear NBC's entire schedule.\nEven with the affiliation swap, it remained in the ratings basement. NBC also lost market share in the Dayton\u2013Springfield area to stronger affiliates in Cincinnati (WLWT, which has a city-grade signal in Dayton and a Grade B signal as far north as Piqua) and Columbus (WCMH-TV, which has a Grade B signal in Springfield and as far north as Bellefontaine). Since WKEF already had to compete in its own market with WDTN and CBS affiliate WHIO-TV\u2014two of their networks' strongest performers\u2014it found the going rather difficult.\nIn 1984, the Springfield Television group (WKEF, WWLP, and KSTU in Salt Lake City) was sold to Adams Communications. That company broke up the group in the late 1980s selling WKEF to KT Communications in 1989. KT invested millions in new equipment, updated the on-air look, and hired almost a completely new staff. However, it was not enough to get WKEF out of last place. Even with NBC's powerhouse prime time lineup in the 1980s and early 1990s, it was the third station in what was basically a two-station market.\nKT sold WKEF to Max Television (later Max Media Properties) in 1995. Ratings improved, but WKEF remained a distant third. In 1998, Max sold WKEF to Sinclair in a group deal. Later that year, Sinclair bought out Sullivan Broadcasting, owners of WRGT-TV in Dayton, and the licensee assets were given to Glencairn, Ltd.[19] In 2001, Sinclair bought most of Sullivan's stations, but could not buy WRGT-TV because the FCC does not allow common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in a market. Also, the Dayton market has only six full-power commercial stations\u2014too few to legally permit a duopoly in any event. Accordingly, WRGT-TV was sold to Glencairn, Ltd. However, this was a sale in name only, as Glencairn's stock was almost entirely owned by the Smith family, founders of Sinclair. This effectively gave Sinclair a duopoly in Dayton. Glencairn, now known as Cunningham Broadcasting, still owns WRGT-TV today as one of several arrangements that has led to allegations of Cunningham being merely a shell corporation for Sinclair. Sinclair has a similar arrangement in Columbus with ABC affiliate WSYX and Fox affiliate WTTE.\n\nReturn to ABC[edit]\nIn early 2004, WDTN became involved in an affiliation deal between NBC and LIN TV (the station's owner at the time); that station took the opportunity to sign up with the more popular network, dropping ABC to switch back to NBC. In response to that deal, Sinclair signed an affiliation agreement with ABC which renewed the network's affiliation agreement with its existing affiliates and caused WKEF and the intellectual unit of WICS and WICD in Springfield and Decatur, Illinois to become ABC affiliates. WKEF rejoined ABC on August 30, 2004 (thus reversing the 1980 swap), and since then has run the entire ABC schedule.[20] Only a few months after returning to ABC, the station and all other Sinclair-owned ABC affiliates (including sister WSYX in Columbus) as well as two other ABC affiliates in Ohio preempted the movie Saving Private Ryan. That decision was made due to the network's plan to air the R-rated film unedited, potentially exposing its affiliated stations to FCC scrutiny if viewers complained about the film's graphic violence and coarse language even though some of Sinclair's stations had already shown the film unedited and uncensored a few months earlier. The incident landed Sinclair at the center of a mild controversy fueling the debate over whether the context of such material should be considered in determining broadcast indecency violations.\nAround November 11, 2010, Sinclair announced that when carriage agreements expired at the end of the year, it planned to pull all of its owned and/or operated TV stations in the United States, including WKEF and WRGT-TV, from Time Warner Cable, in a dispute over \"retransmission fees\".[21][22][23] Negotiations began between the two parties. On December 31, Time Warner reached an agreement with an out-of-market station, presumably Cincinnati's WCPO-TV, to provide ABC network programming at least through the end of February.[24] Later that same day, Sinclair and Time Warner extended talks for another two weeks, with continued cable carriage of Sinclair's stations, through January 14, 2011.[25]\nOn January 15, 2011, after a 24-hour extension of the previous deadline,[26] Time Warner and Sinclair reached a tentative settlement.[27]\nAfter further negotiations, a final agreement was reached on February 2, 2011, keeping WKEF and WRGT-TV on Time Warner.[28][29][30]\nOn February 21, 2012, the Miamisburg City Council approved a $150,000 loan to Sinclair, which planned to move the WKEF/WRGT-TV studios from Soldiers Home-West Carrollton Road in Dayton, and to move their business and sales offices from Broadcast Plaza (the former WRGT-TV studios),[31] consolidating all within the former studios of CW affiliate WBDT on Corporate Place, off Byers Road, in Miamisburg. Sinclair expected to spend $5 million on renovations to its new facility, making it fully digital and high definition.[32][33] The stations had anticipated moving into their new studios in November 2012; the move was finalized on January 27, 2013, with high definition newscasts, updated graphics and new logos on both stations.[34][35]\n\nNews operation[edit]\nDuring the station's early years, channel 22 had no local newscasts. WKEF established a news department in mid-1972 in response to licensing requirements with two weeknight broadcasts in mid-1972. Mark Pierce was named news director, with anchor John Getter, sports from Billy McCool, and meteorologist Virginia Bigler. Bigler was granted the American Meteorological Society Seal of Approval based on her weather segments, becoming the second female meteorologist in the United States to receive this. The news department was discontinued after the Xenia tornado in 1974. The final Eyewitness News at 11 was anchored by Paul Douglas (Wilson) who had joined the WKEF staff as an anchor, reporter, and producer in 1973.\nFrom 1974 to 1979, WKEF decided against airing its own newscasts possibly owing to low ratings. It relied instead on brief audio-only news updates from newscasters from local radio station WING-AM. It ran these updates at selected times in the morning, afternoon, and evening using a still slide on-screen with a picture of the newscaster. WKEF brought back full news programs in 1979 under the moniker 22 Alive! News with anchors Tom Miller and Jack Marschall.\nIn 1998, sister station WRGT-TV began airing a nightly 10 p.m. newscast, now known as FOX 45 News at 10, using WKEF's news team.\nOn June 12, 2006, WKEF began airing a weekday morning program from 5 to 7 a.m., called ABC 22 Good Morning. On the same day, WRGT-TV began airing FOX 45 in the Morning from 7 to 9\u00a0a.m. weekdays.[36]\nIn August 2008, FOX 45 Dayton's News Source at 6:30 was added to WRGT-TV, airing on weeknights against the national news broadcasts on the \"Big Three\" stations.\nIn terms of ratings, WKEF's newscasts have always been a distant third place behind WHIO and WDTN. However, on some nights (usually Sundays because of ABC programming) there are times that WKEF is runner-up to WHIO. WKEF did not participate in the wider implementation of Sinclair's now-defunct, controversial News Central format for its newscasts but did air The Point, a one-minute conservative political commentary hosted by Mark E. Hyman, that was also controversial and a requirement of all Sinclair-owned stations with newscasts until the series was discontinued in December 2006.\nAs of July 21, 2012, with WDTN's upgrade to high definition local newscasts, WKEF and WRGT-TV remained the only two \"Big Four\" network-affiliated television stations in the Dayton area that continued to broadcast their newscasts in pillarboxed 4:3 standard definition. WHIO-TV was the first to have made the upgrade to full high definition. Dean Ditmer, general manager of the stations, announced that WKEF and WRGT-TV would upgrade to HD in 2012 with a new set;[37] the existing set had been in use since January 1995. On October 29, 2012, the stations began constructing their new set at their future Corporate Place studios. HD newscasts from the new studios began on January 27, 2013.[34][35]\nIn August 2015, the station began branding its newscasts as Fox 45 News on ABC, using its sister station's branding. In September 2018, the station returned to using ABC 22 News.\nThe station made national headlines on May 28, 2019, when a video surfaced of the station's news department cutting into the previous night's airing of The Bachelorette for a breaking news story on a tornado warning in the area, and meteorologist Jamie Simpson firing back at social media complaints about the preemption by stating that saving people's lives was more important than an episode of The Bachelorette.[38] Simpson later apologized for his rant but said he did not regret the station preempting the series in favor of safety; Bachelorette contestant Hannah Brown sided with Simpson. Some viewers also sided with Simpson and said that they appreciated \"putting those complaining in their place\". As tornadoes did indeed hit the Dayton area later that night, The Weather Channel cited Simpson's rant as \"possibly saving lives\".[39][40][41]\nOn July 9, 2019, the station rebranded its news operation as Dayton 24/7 Now, sharing that brand with WRGT-TV. It introduced streaming apps and a social media presence with the same name and redirected its former website, www.abc22now.com. In addition, it tweaked its graphics to a different variation used by Sinclair stations.[42][43]\n\nNotable alumni[edit]\nBarry Hobart, better known as \"Dr. Creep\", host of Shock Theater (aka Saturday Night Dead); died in 2011\nBilly McCool, former sports anchor (1972\u20131974); died in 2014\nTechnical information[edit]\nSubchannels[edit]\nThe station's signal is multiplexed:\n\n\nSubchannels of WKEF[44]\n\n\nChannel\n\nRes.\n\nAspect\n\nShort name\n\nProgramming\n\n\n22.1\n\n720p\n16:9\nABC\nABC\n\n\n22.2\n\nFOX45\nFox\n\n\n22.3\n\n480i\nMyTV\nMyNetworkTV / The Nest\n\n\n45.1\n\n480i\n16:9\nDabl\nDabl (WRGT-TV)\n\n\n45.2\n\n4:3\nTBD\nTBD (WRGT-DT2)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Broadcast on behalf of another station\nWKEF aired The Tube on DT2 and Time Warner Cable digital channel 723. WKEF and other Sinclair stations dropped The Tube on December 31, 2006. In October 2010, WKEF began airing TheCoolTV on DT2. On April 12, 2011, Time Warner Cable began airing TheCoolTV on digital channel 996. Sinclair dropped TheCoolTV from all its stations, including WKEF, on August 31, 2012.[45] Starting June 30, 2014, WKEF began airing GetTV on its second digital subchannel. On January 1, 2015, WKEF began airing Grit on its third digital subchannel.[46] On January 1, 2016, the Antenna TV network was scheduled to be added on the third digital subchannel.[47][48] Instead the third digital subchannel was changed to Antenna TV on December 4, 2015, while Grit was moved to a new fourth digital subchannel. On February 15, 2016, GetTV was dropped from DT2 and replaced by Sinclair's American Sports Network. On February 28, 2017, Grit was dropped from DT4 and replaced by Sinclair's TBD. Around March 9, 2017, after and seemingly due to numerous viewer complaints, TBD was dropped from DT4 and Grit was restored. It was later revealed that Grit had been restored because WKEF had not provided Grit the mandatory 90-day notice that it was being dropped. On June 15, 2017, TBD was restored to DT4.  On September 6, 2017, American Sports Network merged into Sinclair's jointly-owned Stadium, with DT2 changing accordingly.\nOn December 29, 2020, the station announced that on January 1, 2021, the main subchannel of sister station WRGT-TV, a Fox affiliate branded as \"Fox 45\", would be moving to 22.2. In addition, Stadium and TBD would be moving from WKEF to subchannels of WRGT-TV. The station advised over-the-air viewers to rescan on that date.[49] The \"Fox 45\" branding remained on 22.2, with the logo similar to that previously used by WRGT-TV, except that callsign was replaced by \"WKEF(TV) 22.2\". The former home of TBD, 22.4, was dropped.\nOn April 19, 2021, Antenna TV moved from 22.3 to 45.3 on sister station WRGT-TV. MyNetworkTV in prime time moved to 22.3 from 45.1, while Stadium outside of prime time also moved to 22.3, from 45.5, returning to WKEF.\nOn October 30, 2023, Sinclair replaced Stadium with its new network The Nest; as was done with Stadium, The Nest airs outside of prime time while MyNetworkTV continues to air in prime time on 22.3.\n\nAnalog-to-digital conversion[edit]\nWKEF shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 22, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 51.[50][51] Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 22.\nAs part of the SAFER Act,[52] WKEF kept its analog signal on the air until June 26 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.\nAfter that, analog transmissions on channel 22 continued, except now at low power, rebroadcasting WRGT-DT2's MyNetworkTV and This TV programming. Initially, this new low-power analog broadcast operated under Cincinnati sister station WSTR-TV's Dayton translator license, W66AQ (formerly on channel 66). On June 30, 2010, W66AQ's call letters were changed to W22DE. On December 8, 2010, Cincinnati's WCPO-TV moved its digital operations to channel 22. (According to RabbitEars, this knocked W22DE off the air;[53] however, W22DE filed for a license renewal with the FCC on June 3, 2013.)[54] The W22DE license was canceled by Sinclair on May 28, 2021.[55]\nIn a petition published by the FCC on September 18, 2014, WKEF requested moving the station's digital signal from channel 51 to channel 18. This request was made as part of WKEF's agreement with T-Mobile to eliminate potential interference with that company's wireless operations adjacent to channel 51.[56] The move to channel 18 was completed on July 16, 2015.[57]\nWKEF moved its digital signal from channel 18 to channel 34 at 10 a.m. on October 18, 2019, as part of the FCC's spectrum reallocation process.[58][59][60] The station's transmitter power was reduced from 525 kW to 47.86\u00a0kW, pending a construction permit with the FCC to increase power to 950\u00a0kW.[61][62][63][64] New antennas for both WKEF and WRGT-TV were installed via helicopter prior to December 23, 2019[65] and were connected to interim auxiliary transmitters on January 24, 2020; the station predicted that the transmitter work would be completed soon after.[66]\n\nSee also[edit]\nChannel 22 virtual TV stations in the United States\nChannel 34 digital TV stations in the United States\nChannel 45 branded TV stations in the United States\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Facility Technical Data for WKEF\".

A majority of the city is located in Polk County, a minority of the city is located in Dallas County, and small portions extend into Warren and Madison counties.\nAs of the 2020 census, the city population was 68,723.[3] West Des Moines is the second-most populous city in the Des Moines metropolitan area and the sixth-most populous city in Iowa.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nThis section may be confusing or unclear to readers. Please help clarify the section. There might be a discussion about this on the talk page. (March 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nSettlement and early history[edit]\nThe West Des Moines area used to be home to the Sac and Fox tribes. Near the stroke of midnight on October 11, 1845, a gunshot was fired by a cattle farmer, James Cunningham Jordan (1813\u20131893) to declare that the area was open for Anglo-European settlement. His residence, the Jordan House, has been restored and is now home to the West Des Moines Historical Society. The Jordan House was a stop on the Underground Railroad, and abolitionist John Brown stayed on Jordan property multiple times, at least once while escorting a group of freedom-seeking slaves to Canada. In West Des Moines' early years, the town was a trading and shipping junction. West Des Moines incorporated as the city of Valley Junction on October 9, 1893.\nIn its early days, Valley Junction was home to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad's switching facilities and repair shops due to its location at the junction of several railroad lines. The Rock Island's facilities moved out of Valley Junction and back into Des Moines in 1936.\nThe speed limit of ten miles (16\u00a0km) an hour had existed for all automobiles Valley Junction since 1911. However, 1915 an Englishman named Jack Prince built a one-mile (1.6\u00a0km) oval race track, designed to let race cars break that speed limit ten times over. The wooden track was made of 980,000 feet (300,000\u00a0m) of 2x4's laid on edge. It was one of 24 such tracks nationwide; it haf seating for over 10,000 people. On August 7, 1915, the eyes of the auto world were on Valley Junction in anticipation of the fastest 300-mile (480\u00a0km) auto race in history. Ralph DePalma, winner of the Indianapolis 500 that year, was one of at least a dozen drivers vying for the $10,000 purse. Before a crowd of 7,000 people, a tire blew, lunging Joe Cooper's car over the rail. Cooper was killed and his mechanic was injured. Later while rounding a curb, a wheel of Billy Chandler's Duesenberg failed, cartwheeling the car into the infield and fatally injuring his mechanic, Maurice Keeler. Chandler was seriously injured.[4] Smiling Ralph Mulford won the race with DePalma a close 2nd. This baptism by blood left a bad taste in the mouth of the locals, and the track was closed two years later. The wood was salvaged and then used to construct buildings in Valley Junction.\nThe serious dilemma of school overcrowding was partially addressed in 1916. The bond issue to build a new high school for $50,000 was approved by a two-to-one vote. The similar new grade school issue was defeated soundly. Building commenced and by September of the following year, the doors of the new Valley High School were opened at 8th and Hillside. As a part of the school board policy, only first-class college-educated teachers were hired. By 1919, the rooms of the new high school were filled. A new junior high school was proposed, approved, and completed by the fall of 1923.\nThe new school was the only bright spot in the otherwise uncertain dreary years of 1922 and 1923. The foundations of the city were shaken by a 22-month-machinist strike at the Rock Island shops. Starting 1922-07-01, 600 workers were idled. The railroad company reacted by bringing replacement workers into town to break the strike. The replacements were mostly Mexican and African-American laborers brought up from Oklahoma by R. C. Hyde, the master mechanic at the shops. For their own protection, they lived in boxcars and tiny houses in an area south of Railroad Avenue and west of the main rail yards. The area was dubbed \"Hyde Park\" by the strikers. The resulting hardships suffered by the idled workers led the most desperate to choose between breaking the strike or letting their family starve. It was a time which pitted neighbor against neighbor, tearing at the fabric of the community. Two men shot themselves in desperation before the strike ended.\nValley Junction officially become a dry town in 1915. The Des Moines Golf and Country Club left Des Moines in 1923 and moved to White Pole Road auto trail.[5]  By the late 1920s, workers of Valley Junction were suffering from the Depression because the railroads were abandoning track there (completed in 1936), and the Keystone Coal Factory closed due to flooding in the tunnels.[citation needed]\n\nA New Name[edit]\nBy 1937, only two trains stopped daily; the sagging business climate needed a boost. Members of the commercial club believed the only way to attract new industries would be to change the name of the city. They thought the name \"Valley Junction\" conveyed the image of an old-fashioned and backward town to prospective employers and residents. The name of \"West Des Moines\" would give it the respectability and prestige the town desperately needed. There was a precedent by way of an editorial in the Valley Junction Express in 1905 that suggested dropping \"Junction\" from the name, but nothing came of it. The opposition feared the change to West Des Moines would cause property owners to be taxed the same as Des Moines. It was also declared as a step toward annexation by Des Moines. A third and final election was held on December 7, 1937.\nOn January 1, 1938, the name \"Valley Junction\" was relegated to the past, and the new city of West Des Moines took the first steps to a new identity. Helping to establish this new identity, the most identifiable trait was the suspension of all property taxes between 1936 and 1938. This was due to the profits of the water department. Today the original business district of West Des Moines has been preserved as Historic Valley Junction. It features many locally owned specialty shops and restaurants as well as a weekly farmers' market.\nThough the name was changed, the community's commitment to education was bolstered by funds from the Public Works Administration. Despite the Depression, a new elementary school and the Old Valley Football Stadium were built and dedicated on May 24, 1939, at 8th and Hillside. The venerable Lincoln School was razed in 1938 to make way for the new building. Longfellow was retired in 1939 and then sold in 1940 for $1000. In 1955, West Des Moines Elementary School at Walnut and 6th was renamed \"Nellie Phenix Elementary\" in honor of the former principal.[6]  The late 1930s were very good years in the school's athletic teams, producing memorable names: True, Gavin, Swink, and Sherbo. Charles Swink was a multi-record holder in track and field. His record at the Drake Relays stood for twenty years.\nAn overgrown concrete eyesore on Ashworth Road soon became the musical mecca for the surrounding area on June 6, 1939, when Tom Archer opened the Val Air Ballroom. The site was originally the location of the stillborn Wilson Rubber company factory. Intended to bolster World War I tire production, the end of the war in 1918 left only a large concrete slab. Patrons of the Val Air could dance under a canopy of stars to the melodious sounds of Guy Lombardo, Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, and other big bands. The war years brought new vitality to the community without a cost.\nThen and now, flooding frequently dampens, but has not broken the residents' spirits. Unpredictable waters of the Raccoon River and Walnut Creek have often exceeded their banks due to large amounts of rain in the summer and snowmelt in the spring, filling the streets and damaging homes and businesses.\n\n1950 to the present[edit]\nIn 1950, West Des Moines had a population of 5,615, but the city grew as many new housing subdivisions were built. West Des Moines annexed the neighboring community of Clover Hills in 1950, the town of Ashawa, a former Rock Island railroad stop, in 1957, and the town of Commerce, along the Raccoon River, in 1960. City government also grew, and when the venerable city hall could not keep up with the city's expansion, the city opened a new municipal building in 1954. With the influx of students, the school district's ever-expanding borders continually compromised classroom capacity. Children attended school in former homes near Phenix, with classes in hallways and living rooms. Space was even rented from the new Catholic grade school. In 1959 alone, 150\u2013200 new homes were built, adding to the population's growth. The construction of Interstate 35, Interstate 80, and Interstate 235 in the 1960s brought more people and businesses to West Des Moines. This construction also caused the Des Moines Golf and Country Club to sell its location along Ashworth Road and 8th Street and then move to its current location in Dallas County.[5] In 1966, Dowling Catholic High School/St. Joseph Educational Center purchased 55-acre (22\u00a0ha) from the Des Moines Golf and Country Club and, subsequently, moved from Des Moines and opened at its current location, 1400 Buffalo Road, in the fall of 1972.[7] Several retail and office complexes opened along the I-235 corridor after the freeway's completion, including Valley West Mall, which opened in 1975. West Des Moines' population jumped from 11,964 in 1960 to 31,702 in 1990.\nWest Des Moines expanded into Dallas County during the 1990s and 2000s, once again placing the premier golf courses of the Des Moines Golf and Country Club in its city limits and punctuated by the opening of one of the best golf courses in Iowa at the Glen Oaks Country Club[a] along with the West Glen Town Center and the largest in the state of Iowa, Jordan Creek Town Center and shopping mall in 2004. Major commercial construction is underway around the area, including the opening of many additional hotels, shopping centers, and office buildings, including a new Wells Fargo corporate campus. In 2007, construction started on the Village of Ponderosa, an urban-inspired and pedestrian-friendly community. In 2005, West Des Moines annexed land in Warren County for the first time. Seeing the land to the south of Des Moines as extremely valuable, especially with the completion of a major \"South-Belt Freeway\" system, the cities of Norwalk and West Des Moines are actively competing for land in the northern part of Warren County. From 1990 to 2015, West Des Moines is the fastest growing city in Iowa according to the landmass.\nDuring the 1990s, a new city/school campus opened near the intersection of South 35th Street and Mills Civic Parkway. West Des Moines' new police station opened in April 1992. This was followed by the opening of a new public library in 1996; the library served as a temporary home for West Des Moines' city hall until a new building was dedicated in late 2002. The campus also features a new stadium for Valley High School that also opened in 2002. On the same property, the West Des Moines School district operates Valley Southwoods, a freshman high school with over 600 students that opened in 1996. Turning the West Des Moines Community Schools into a two high school district was not acceptable. In 2004, August Hillside Elementary opened on the former site of Hillside Junior High and Old Valley Stadium, which was demolished in 2001. In 2012, Clegg Park Elementary was renovated and opened as the new Walnut Creek Campus which is the district's alternative high school. Major renovation and additions were completed at Valley High in 2007 and again in 2015.[6]\n\nGeography[edit]\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 39.48 square miles (102.25\u00a0km2), of which 38.59 square miles (99.95\u00a0km2) is land and 0.89 square miles (2.31\u00a0km2) is water.[10] West Des Moines' location in the Raccoon River valley has left parts of the city, particularly the Valley Junction area, prone to flooding. After the Great Flood of 1993, a floodwall was constructed along Walnut Creek (near the boundary with Des Moines) to protect that area.\n\nClimate[edit]\nWest Des Moines has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa).\n\n\n\n\nClimate data for West Des Moines\n\n\nMonth\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nAug\n\nSep\n\nOct\n\nNov\n\nDec\n\nYear\n\n\nMean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n\n26(\u22123)\n\n36(2)\n\n48(9)\n\n61(16)\n\n72(22)\n\n82(28)\n\n86(30)\n\n84(29)\n\n76(24)\n\n63(17)\n\n47(8)\n\n33(1)\n\n60(16)\n\n\nMean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n\n12(\u221211)\n\n18(\u22128)\n\n29(\u22122)\n\n40(4)\n\n51(11)\n\n61(16)\n\n66(19)\n\n64(18)\n\n54(12)\n\n42(6)\n\n29(\u22122)\n\n17(\u22128)\n\n40(4)\n\n\nAverage precipitation inches (mm)\n\n1.03(26)\n\n1.19(30)\n\n2.21(56)\n\n3.58(91)\n\n4.25(108)\n\n4.57(116)\n\n4.18(106)\n\n4.51(115)\n\n3.15(80)\n\n2.62(67)\n\n2.10(53)\n\n1.33(34)\n\n34.72(882)\n\n\nSource: Weather Channel[11]\n\n\nStreet numbering[edit]\nWhile nearby Clive, Urbandale, and Windsor Heights use the same street numbers for north\u2013south streets that Des Moines uses, West Des Moines uses its own street numbering system. Thus, 86th Street in Clive and Urbandale becomes 22nd Street in West Des Moines. Iowa Highway 28, which forms most of the boundary between Des Moines and West Des Moines, is 63rd Street in Des Moines but 1st Street in West Des Moines. Many of the east\u2013west streets share the same name with Des Moines, although the numbering of these east\u2013west streets starts over in West Des Moines.\n\nDemographics[edit]\n\n\nHistorical population\nCensusPop.Note%\u00b1\n19001,700\u201419102,57351.4%19203,63141.1%19304,28017.9%19404,252\u22120.7%19505,61532.1%196011,949112.8%197016,44137.6%198021,89433.2%199031,70244.8%200046,40346.4%201056,60922.0%202068,72321.4%2022 (est.)70,7412.9%U.S. Decennial Census[12]2018 Estimate[13]\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $54,139, and the median income for a family was $70,600 (in a 2008 estimate, these figures had risen to $61,256 and $83,800 respectively, in 2008 inflation-adjusted dollars[14]).

Microsoft maintains several data centers in West Des Moines including, as of September 2023, its most advanced supercomputer because heat from the supercomputer can be vented with outside air when air temperatures are below 29.3\u00a0\u00b0C (84.7\u00a0\u00b0F) and thus significantly reduce the amount of water used for cooling.[19] This location supported training for ChatGPT.[19]\n\nTop employers[edit]\nAccording to West Des Moines' 2018 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[20] the top employers in the city are:\n\n\n\n#\n\nEmployer\n\n# of employees\n\n\n1\n\nWells Fargo Home Mortgage & Credit Services\n\n9,569\n\n\n2\n\nWest Des Moines Community School District\n\n1,509\n\n\n3\n\nHy-Vee\n\n1,205\n\n\n4\n\nAthene USA Corporation\n\n1,100\n\n\n5\n\nFBL Financial Group\n\n1,011\n\n\n6\n\nUniversal Pediatrics\n\n985\n\n\n7\n\nThe Iowa Clinic\n\n950\n\n\n8\n\nIowa Realty Co., Inc.\n\n740\n\n\n9\n\nGuideOne Insurance\n\n651\n\n\n10\n\nAureon\n\n650\n\nGovernment[edit]\nWest Des Moines uses the mayor-council form of government with a city manager appointed by the city council. The council consists of the mayor, two at-large members, and three members from each of the city's three wards. The mayor and all council members serve four-year terms. Rick Messerschmidt served as the interim mayor of the city following former mayor Eugene Meyer's resignation in January 2007; On April 17, Steve Gaer was elected mayor during a special election and held that position until Russ Trimble was elected Mayor in November 2021.[21][22] Tom Hadden is the city manager of West Des Moines.\n\nEducation[edit]\nThe West Des Moines Community School District has nine elementary schools, two junior high schools, and one high school (Valley), with a second high school for freshmen only (Valley Southwoods) and an alternative high school (Walnut Creek Campus).

In 1875, 17 percent of national constitutions included a right to bear arms. Since the early twentieth century, \"the proportion has been less than 9 percent and falling\".[9] In an article titled \"U.S. Gun Rights Truly Are American Exceptionalism,\" a historical survey and comparative analysis of constitutions dating back to 1789,[9] Tom Ginsburg and colleagues \"identified only 15 constitutions (in nine countries) that had ever included an explicit right to bear arms. Almost all of these constitutions have been in Latin America, and most were from the 19th century\".[10]\n\nCountries recognizing the right to keep and bear arms[edit]\nNorth America[edit]\nGuatemala[edit]\n\n\nThe right to own weapons for personal use, not prohibited by the law, in the place of inhabitation, is recognized. There will not be an obligation to hand them over, except in cases ordered by a competent judge.[11]\n\n\nArticle 38 of Guatemala Constitution\n\n See also: Gun law in Guatemala\nWhile protecting the right to keep arms, Guatemalan constitution specifies that this right extends only to \"weapons not prohibited by law\".\n\nHonduras[edit]\n\n\nEvery person, in the exercise of their civil rights, may request a maximum of five (5) license for the possession and carrying of up to five (5) firearms by submitting an application with the following information[12] (...)\n (1) Form with personal information and residence; (2) Brand, model, serial number, identification of modification of calibre, if any; as well as any other characteristics of the weapon; (3) Proof of having undertaken a ballistic test; (4) Payment of municipal matriculation and criminal background check; and, (5) Identification documents.\n\nArticle 27 of Decree No. 69-2007, Modifying the Act on the Control of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials (Honduras)\n\n The constitution of Honduras does not protect the right to keep and bear arms.\nAlthough not explicitly mentioned in the legislation, every person is entitled to receive a license to keep and carry arms by Honduran Statute law, provided that they fulfill the conditions required by the law.[13]\n\nMexico[edit]\n\n\nThe inhabitants of the United Mexican States have the right to possess arms within their domicile, for their safety and legitimate defense, except those forbidden by Federal Law and those reserved for the exclusive use of the Army, Militia, Air Force and National Guard. Federal law shall provide in what cases, conditions, under what requirements and in which places inhabitants shall be authorized to bear arms.[14]\n\n\nArticle 10 of Mexican Constitution\n\n See also: Gun politics in Mexico\nThe Mexican constitution of 1857 first included the right to be armed. In its first version, the right was defined in similar terms as it is in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. A new Mexican constitution of 1917 relativized the right, stating that its utilization must be in line with local police regulations.\nAnother change was included in 1917 Constitution. Since then, Mexicans have the right to be armed only within their home and further utilization of this right is subject to statutory authorization in Federal law.\n\nUnited States[edit]\n\n\nA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.[15]\n\n\nSecond Amendment to the United States Constitution\n\n Main article: Right to keep and bear arms in the United States\nFurther information: Second Amendment to the United States Constitution\nIn the United States, which has an English common law tradition, a longstanding common-law right to keep and bear arms was practiced prior to the creation of a written national constitution.[16] Today, this right is specifically protected by the United States Constitution and many state constitutions.[17]\n\nEurope[edit]\nCzech Republic[edit]\n\n\nThe right to acquire, keep and bear firearms is guaranteed under conditions set by this law.\n\n\nArticle 1 Subsection 1 of Czech Firearms Act\n\n\n\n\n(1) Everyone has the right to life. Human life is worthy of protection even before birth. (2) Nobody may be deprived of their life. (3) The death penalty is prohibited. (4) Deprivation of life is not inflicted in contravention of this Article if it occurs in connection with conduct which is not criminal under the law. The right to defend own life or life of another person also with arms is guaranteed under conditions set out in the law.[18]\n\n\nConstitutional amendment of Czech Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms passed in 2021. Most of the Article is preexisting, the last sentence in subsection 4 was newly added.\n\n Main article: Gun laws in the Czech Republic Further information: History of Czech civilian firearms possession\nHistorically, the Czech lands were at the forefront of the spreading of civilian firearms ownership.[19] In the 1420s and 1430s, firearms became indispensable tools for the mostly peasant Hussite armies whose amateur combatants, including women, fended off a series of invasions of professional crusader armies of well-armored warriors with cold weapons.[19] Throughout and after the Hussite wars, firearms' design underwent fast development and their possession by civilians became a matter of course.[19]\nTheir first firearms regulation was enacted in 1517 as a part of general accord between the nobles and burghers and later in 1524 as a standalone Enactment on Firearms (z\u0159\u00edzen\u00ed o ru\u010dnic\u00edch). The 1517 law explicitly stated that \"all people of all standing have the right to keep firearms at home\" while at the same time enacting a universal carry ban.[19] The 1524 enactment set out a process of issuing of permits for carrying of firearms and detailed enforcement and punishment for carrying without such a permit.[19] Carrying later became permitless again until 1852, when Imperial Regulation No. 223 reintroduced carry permits. This law remained in force until the 1939 German invasion.[19]\nSince its inception during the Hussite revolution, the right to keep firearms endured over five-hundred years until the Nazi gun ban during the German occupation in the 20th century. Firearms possession later became subject to several legal conditions during the communist period. After the Velvet revolution, the Czech Republic instated a shall issue permitting process, under which all residents can keep and bear arms subject to the fulfillment of regulatory conditions.[19]\nIn the Czech Republic, every resident that meets conditions laid down in Act No. 119/2002 Coll.[20] has the right to have a firearms license issued and can then obtain a firearm.[21][22] Holders of D (exercise of profession) and E (self-defense) licenses, which are also shall-issue, can carry up to two concealed firearms for protection.[23] The right to be armed is statutorily protected.\nA proposal to have right to keep and bear arms included in the constitution was entered in the Czech Parliament in December 2016.[24] The proposal was approved by vote of 139 to 9 on 28 June 2017 by the Chamber of Deputies. It later failed to reach necessary support in Senate, where only 28 out of 59 Senators present supported it (with constitutional majority being 36 votes).[25] A new proposal was entered by 35 Senators in September 2019[26] and then approved on 21 July 2021, adding a new sentence, according to which \"the right to defend one's own life or the life of another person even with the use of a weapon is guaranteed under the conditions set by the law.\"[27]\n\nSwitzerland[edit]\n\n\nThe right to acquire, keep and bear arms is guaranteed within boundaries of this law.\n\n\nArticle 3 of Swiss Firearms Act\n\n\nFurther information: Gun laws in Switzerland\nThe Swiss have a statutory right to bear arms under Article 3 of the 1997 Weapons Act.[28][a] Switzerland practices universal conscription, which requires that all able-bodied male citizens keep fully automatic firearms at home in case of a call-up. Each male between the ages of 20 and 34 is considered a candidate for conscription into the military, and following a brief period of active duty will commonly be enrolled in the militia until age or an inability to serve ends his obligation.[29] Until December 2009, these men were required to keep their government-issued selective fire combat rifles and semi-automatic handguns in their homes as long as they were enrolled in the armed forces.[30] Since January 2010, they have had the option of depositing their personal firearm at a government arsenal.[31] Until September 2007, soldiers received 50 rounds of government-issued ammunition in a sealed box for storage at home; after 2007 only about 2,000 specialist troops are allowed to keep the ammunition at home.[32]\nIn a referendum in February 2011, voters rejected a citizens' initiative that would have obliged members of the armed services to store their rifles and pistols on military compounds and required that privately owned firearms be registered.[33]\n\nUnited Kingdom[edit]\n\n\nThat the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.\n\n\nBill of Rights 1689\n\n\nSee also: Firearms policy in the United Kingdom\nSee also: Self-defence in English law\nSee also: Offensive weapon \u00a7\u00a0UK\nIn the United Kingdom, there is no automatic right to bear arms,[34] although citizens may possess certain firearms on obtaining an appropriate licence.[35]  Ordinary members of the public may own sporting rifles and shotguns, subject to licensing, while handguns, automatic, and centerfire semi-automatic weapons are illegal to possess without special additional conditions.[34][36]\nWhen not attended, all licensed firearms must be stored securely (locked) and separate from their ammunition. Regulations for airguns are less stringent and air pistols with a muzzle energy not exceeding 6 foot-pounds force (8.1 joules) and other airguns with a muzzle energy not exceeding 12\u00a0ft\u22c5lbf (16 J) do not require any certificates or licensing, although the same storage requirement applies.\nThe first serious control on firearms was established with the passing of the Firearms Act 1920,[37] handgun restrictions being added in response to the 1996 Dunblane Massacre in which 18 people died.\nHistorically the English Bill of Rights 1689 allowed:\n\nThat the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.[38]\nSince 1953, it has been a criminal offence in the United Kingdom to carry a knife (with the exception of non-locking folding knives with a cutting edge of 3 inches (7.62 centimetres) or less) or any \"offensive weapon\" in a public place without lawful authority (e.g. police or security forces) or reasonable excuse (e.g. tools that are needed for work). The cutting edge of a knife is separate to the blade length. The only manner in which an individual may carry arms is on private property or any property to which the public does not have a lawful right of access, as the law only creates the offence when it occurs in public,[39][40] e.g., a person's own home, private land, the area in a shop where the public have no access, etc. Furthermore, Criminal Justice Act 1988 Section 141 specifically lists all offensive weapons that cannot technically be owned, even on private property, by way of making it illegal to sell, trade, hire, etc. an offensive weapon to another person.[41]\nFurthermore, the law does not allow an offensive weapon or ordinary item intended or adapted as an offensive weapon to be carried in public before the threat of violence arises. This would only be acceptable in the eyes of the law if the person armed themselves immediately preceding or during an attack (in a public place). This is known as a \"weapon of opportunity\" or \"instantaneous arming\".[40]\n\nOther[edit]\nSharia law[edit]\nUnder Sharia law, there is an intrinsic freedom to own arms. However, in times of civil strife or internal violence, this right can be temporarily suspended to keep peace and prevent harm, as mentioned by Imam ash-Shatibi in his works on Maqasid ash-Shari'ah (The Intents and Purposes of Shari'ah).[42][43] Citizens not practicing Islam are prohibited from bearing arms and are required to be protected by the military, the state for which they pay the jizyah. In exchange they do not need to pay the zakat.[44][45][46][47]\n\nYemen[edit]\n\n\nThe citizens of the Republic shall have the right to hold the necessary rifles, machine guns, revolvers, and hunting rifles for their personal use with an amount of ammunition for the purpose of legitimate defense.[48]\n\n\nLaw Regulating Carrying Firearms, Ammunition & their Trade\n\n Main article: Gun law in Yemen\nYemen recognizes statutory right to keep and bear arms. Firearms are both easily and legally accessible.[49][50]\n\n\nGun violence and the politics of the right to bear arms[edit]\nGun-related homicide and suicide rates in high-income OECD countries, 2010, countries in graph ordered by total death rates (homicide plus suicide plus other gun-related deaths)[51]\nMultiple studies show that where people have easy access to firearms, gun-related deaths tend to be more frequent, including by suicide, homicide, and unintentional injuries.[52]\nLegal restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms are usually put in place by legislators in an attempt to reduce firearm-based violence and crime.[53][54][55] Their actions may be the result of political groups advocating for such regulations. The Brady Campaign, Snowdrop Campaign, and the Million Mom March are examples of campaigns calling for tighter restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms. Accident statistics can be hard to obtain, but much data is available on the issue of gun ownership and gun related deaths.\n\nUnited Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute[edit]\nThe United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) has made comparisons between countries with different levels of gun ownership and investigated the correlation between gun ownership levels and gun homicides, and between gun ownership levels and gun suicides. A \"substantial correlation\" is seen in both:[56]\n\nDuring the 1989 and 1992 International Crime Surveys, data on gun ownership in eighteen countries have been collected on which WHO data on suicide and homicide committed with guns and other means are also available. The results presented in a previous paper based on the fourteen countries surveyed during the first ICS and on rank correlations (Spearman's rho), suggested that gun ownership may increase suicides and homicides using firearms, while it may not reduce suicides and homicides with other means. In the present analysis, four additional countries covered by the 1992 ICS only have been included, and Pearson's correlation coefficients have been used. The results confirm those presented in the previous study.\u2014\u200aMartin Killias, Understanding Crime, Experiences of Crime and Crime Control \u2013 Acts of the International Conference[57]\nUNICRI also investigated the relationship between gun ownership levels and other forms of homicide or suicide to determine whether high levels of gun ownership added to or merely displaced other forms of homicide or suicide. They reported that \"widespread gun ownership has not been found to reduce the likelihood of fatal events committed with other means. Thus, people do not turn to knives and other potentially lethal instruments less often when more guns are available, but more guns usually means more victims of suicide and homicide.\" The researchers concluded that \"all we know is that guns do not reduce fatal events due to other means, but that they go along with more shootings. Although we do not know why exactly this is so, we have a good reason to suspect guns to play a fatal role in this\".[56]\nThis research found that guns were the major cause of homicides in three of the fourteen countries it studied: Northern Ireland, Italy, and the United States.[56] Although some data indicates that reducing the availability of one significant type of arms\u2014firearms\u2014leads to reductions both in gun crimes and gun suicides and moderate reductions in overall crimes and overall suicides, the author did caution that \"reducing the number of guns in the hands of the private citizen may become a hopeless task beyond a certain point,\" citing the American example where gun laws remain a subject of heated debate (see also Gun politics in the United States).[56]\nA posterior study by UNICRI researchers from 2001 examined the link between household gun ownership and overall homicide, overall suicide, as well as gun homicide and gun suicide rates amongst 21 countries. The researchers declared \"The results show very strong correlations between the presence of guns in the home and suicide committed with a gun, rates of gun-related homicide involving female victims, and gun-related assault.\"[58] There were no significant correlations detected for total homicide and suicide rates, as well as gun homicide rates involving male victims.[58]\n\nOther[edit]\nSome other research indicates that gun levels do not affect the total number of homicides or the total number of suicides, but rather affect the share of homicides or suicides committed with guns.[59]\nPublic-health critic, gun-rights proponent, and editor-in-chief of Surgical Neurology International Miguel Faria contended in 2012 that keeping and bearing arms not only has constitutional protection, but also that firearms have beneficial aspects that have been ignored by the public health establishment in which he played a part.[60] He also contended that guns are beneficial in self-defense, collective defense, and in protecting life and property.[60][61]\nA 2012 study in the journal Annual Review of Public Health found that suicide rates are greater in households with firearms than those without them.[62]\n\nSee also[edit]\nIndex of gun politics articles\nList of countries by gun ownership\nOverview of gun laws by nation\nRight of self-defense\nKnife legislation\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Art. 3 Recht auf Waffenerwerb, Waffenbesitz und Waffentragen: Das Recht auf Waffenerwerb, Waffenbesitz und Waffentragen ist im Rahmen dieses Gesetzes gew\u00e4hrleistet.\" (The right to acquire, possess and carry arms is guaranteed in the framework of this law.)\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Halbrook, Stephen P.

It is bounded on the northeast by the railroad and the Chosewood Park neighborhood; on the northwest by the railroad and the BeltLine and the Peoplestown neighborhood, on the west by High Point and the Villages at Carver, and on the south mostly by Turman Street and the Lakewood Heights neighborhood.\n\nHistory[edit]\nSouth Atlanta was originally known as Brownsville. Author Ray Stannard Baker in The Atlanta Riot described it in 1907, in the tone illustrating the presuppositions with which white Americans wrote about African Americans at that time; but nonetheless illustrating the industriousness of Brownsville at the time:\n\nWhen I went out to Brownsville, knowing of its bloody part in the riot, I expected to find a typical negro slum. I looked for squalor, ignorance, vice. And I was surprised to find a large settlement of negroes practically every one of whom owned his own home, some of the houses being as attractive without and as well furnished within as the ordinary homes of middleclass white people. Near at hand, surrounded by beautiful grounds, were two negro colleges \u2014 Clark University and Gammon Theological Seminary. The post office was kept by a negro. There were several stores owned by negroes. The schoolhouse, though supplied with teachers by the county, was built wholly with money personally contributed by the negroes of the neighborhood, in order that there might be adequate educational facilities for their children. They had three churches and not a saloon. The residents were all of the industrious, property-owning sort, bearing the best reputation among white people who knew them.[1]\nClark University (founded in 1869), moved to a site in South Atlanta in 1883, establishing Gammon Seminary Theological Seminary the same year. In 1941 Clark departed to its present location near Downtown Atlanta when it joined the Atlanta University system. It served as a cultural, religious and community anchor in South Atlanta. Its importance was magnified by the fact that at the time, black artists and performers has little opportunity to perform in the South except on black college campuses, and black audiences had little access to \"white\" cultural activities.  Brownsville became an \"elite\" black community during segregation.\nIn addition, between 1894\u20131915, South Atlanta benefited from the development of Lakewood Park and its agricultural fairs which were held annually 1916\u20131975.[2]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ The Atlanta riot, Ray Stannard Baker\n\n^ South Atlanta Civic League\n\n\nvteNeighborhoods and districts of AtlantaDowntown\nCastleberry Hill\nCentennial Park District\nFairlie\u2013Poplar\nCentennial Hill\nHotel District\nFive Points\nPeachtree Center\nSoNo\nSouth Downtown\nWhitehall Street Retail Historic District\nMidtown\nAnsley Park\nAtlantic Station\nColony Square\nFox Theatre Historic District\nHistoric Midtown\nHome Park\nSherwood Forest\nTechnology Square\nBuckhead\nArdmore\nArgonne Forest\nBrookwood\nBrookwood Hills\nBuckhead Forest\nBuckhead Village\nChastain Park\nCollier Hills\nGarden Hills\nHistoric Brookhaven\nLindbergh\nLoring Heights\nMargaret Mitchell\nNorth Buckhead\nPaces\nPeachtree Hills\nPeachtree Park\nPine Hills\nTuxedo Park\nWest Midtown\nBerkeley Park\nBlandtown\nHome Park\nKnight Park\u2013Howell Station\nMarietta Street Artery\nUnderwood Hills\nWestside Provisions\nEastside\nAtkins Park\nCabbagetown\nCandler Park\nDruid Hills\nEast Atlanta\nEast Lake\nEdgewood\nGrant Park\nGlenwood Park\nInman Park\nKirkwood\nLake Claire\nLindridge/Martin Manor\nLittle Five Points\nMorningside/Lenox Park\nNorth Ormewood Park\nOakland\nOld Fourth Ward\nOrmewood Park\nPiedmont Heights\nPoncey\u2013Highland\nReynoldstown\nSweet Auburn\nVirginia\u2013Highland\nSoutheast\nBenteen Park\nBoulevard Heights\nChosewood Park\nHigh Point\nJoyland\nLakewood Heights\nPeoplestown\nSouth Atlanta\nSummerhill\nWestside\nAdair Park\nAdamsville\nAshview Heights\nBankhead\nBen Hill\nCapitol View\nCapitol View Manor\nCascade Heights\nCenter Hill\nCollier Heights\nDixie Hills\nEnglish Avenue\nFort McPherson\nGreenbriar\nHunter Hills\nJust Us\nMechanicsville\nMidwest Cascade\nMozley Park\nOakland City\nPerkerson\nPeyton Forest\nPittsburgh\nSylvan Hills\nVenetian Hills\nVine City\nWashington Park\nWest End\nWestview\nUpper Westside\nBolton\nCarey Park\nGrove Park\nRiverside\nScotts Crossing\nWhittier Mill Village\n\nList by area\nTable by population\nFormer neighborhoods\nCategory\n\n33\u00b042\u203254\u2033N 84\u00b023\u20326\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff33.71500\u00b0N 84.38500\u00b0W\ufeff / 33.71500; -84.38500\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Atlanta&oldid=1145144418\""

The station's studios are located on South Jefferson Street in downtown Green Bay (across from the historic Brown County Courthouse), with a Fox Cities news bureau on College Avenue on the west side of Appleton, just south of Fox River Mall; its transmitter is located in Ledgeview, Wisconsin.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nAs a CBS affiliate (1953\u20131992)[edit]\nStudios in 2007.\nThe only television station broadcasting in Wisconsin prior to the FCC's 1948 freeze on television licenses was WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee. After the FCC's freeze ended in 1952, WBAY-TV became the second television station on the air in the state, on March 17, 1953. WBAY-TV was originally owned by the Norbertine Order of Priests, whose abbey is in nearby De Pere. The priests run St. Norbert College in De Pere, and already operated WBAY radio (1360 AM, now WTAQ) in Green Bay and WHBY radio in Appleton. Like WTMJ when that station started in 1947 \u2013 as the only station in the market \u2013 WBAY originally carried programming from all four networks of the day \u2013 channel 2 was a primary CBS affiliate with secondary affiliations with NBC, ABC and DuMont.\nABC moved to WNAM-TV (channel 42, now WFRV-TV on channel 5) in Neenah when it started up in January 1954. Then, NBC moved to Marinette's WMBV-TV (channel 11, now Fox affiliate WLUK-TV) when it signed on in September of that year. With the shutdown of DuMont in August 1956, WBAY was left as an exclusive CBS affiliate. The station upgraded its transmitter and began broadcasting network programming in color in the fall of 1956.[2][3] WBAY-TV would remain the only station licensed to Green Bay proper until the 1959 relocation of WLUK to the city. Locally produced programs were broadcast in color starting in 1966.\nThe station's studios in downtown Green Bay were built in 1924 as a former Knights of Columbus clubhouse and later was turned into a private Roman Catholic high school during the Great Depression when the Norbertines took over the building. The former gymnasium/auditorium is now called the WBAY Auditorium and is used as the studio for the station's cerebral palsy telethon. During the early years of WBAY, it served as the main studio until 1954 when an addition was built behind the main building. The auditorium has also been used for local theatrical productions. The station's newsroom is in the basement of the building in an area that originally held a swimming pool and bowling alley. The WBAY building also served as the home of the WBAY radio stations (now WTAQ and WIXX), which were later purchased by Midwest Communications in the late 1970s, but remained in the building until Midwest built a combined Green Bay operations facility/company headquarters in 2007 and a news-weather sharing agreement was maintained between WBAY-TV and its former radio sisters for many years before it was discontinued in favor of an agreement with WLUK-TV.\nAs a CBS affiliate, WBAY-TV benefited from that network's coverage of National Football League games, primarily those of the Green Bay Packers. The station carried its first Packers game a few months after signing on, and continued to air most Packers games until 1991 by virtue of CBS holding the rights to the Packers' conference, the National Football Conference (for the 1992 and 1993 seasons, Packers games moved to WFRV when that station switched to CBS). Packers games drew up to a 90 percent share of the audience during the team's championship era of the 1960s under Vince Lombardi (including the team's first two Super Bowl triumphs in Super Bowl I and Super Bowl II, the former of which was also carried by then-NBC affiliate WFRV), and the station carried the team's coaches' show The Vince Lombardi Show. The station also originated the team's exhibition game coverage from the 1960s to 2002, with some exceptions. Main anchor Bill Jartz has been Lambeau Field's PA system announcer since the start of the 2005\u20132006 season. The station continued to air Monday Night Football Packer games originating from ESPN beginning with the move of MNF to cable starting with the 2006 until the 2015 season. For the 2016 season, WLUK-TV, the Packers' primary home by virtue of Fox presently holding the rights to the NFC, acquired the syndication rights to the ESPN games under a multi-year agreement.[4] It was the first time that WBAY did not broadcast a Packers game during an NFL season in its 63-year history, and the station would not carry another Packers game until December 19, 2022, a home matchup with the Los Angeles Rams, as ABC began to simulcast select Monday Night Football games with ESPN.\nIn 1974, WBAY was sold to Nationwide Communications, which operated the station until 1993, when it was sold to Young Broadcasting along with its two ABC-affiliated sisters WATE-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee and WRIC-TV in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nAs an ABC affiliate (1992\u2013present)[edit]\nIn 1991, CBS purchased the assets of Midwest Television to acquire its long-dominant affiliate in Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul, WCCO-TV. Midwest also owned channel 2's longtime competitor, WFRV. CBS considered WBAY a strong affiliate, and tried to sell WFRV and their Escanaba, Michigan-based satellite station, WJMN-TV, after the deal with Midwest closed. However, after FCC rules were relaxed at the time to allow one company to own more stations, the network decided to keep the two stations as a result and switched WFRV/WJMN to CBS in 1992 (CBS sold WFRV/WJMN to Liberty Media in 2007, the stations are now owned by the Nexstar Media Group).\nAfter it was announced that WFRV would join CBS, channel 2 then decided to take WFRV/WJMN's ABC affiliation; WBAY management insisted that the change take place on or near the anniversary of its sign-on date, March 17. Since that date fell on a Tuesday in 1992, WFRV and WBAY swapped networks on March 15, which fell on a Sunday.[5] This brought WBAY-TV's ABC affiliation in line with sister stations WATE-TV in Knoxville and WRIC-TV in Richmond, which had recently renewed their ABC relationships.\nThe station formerly preempted the first hour of the ABC lineup (7\u20138 p.m. Central) on Tuesday evenings during the football season to carry the local program Tuesday Night Touchback, which was formerly known as Monday Night Countdown before it was moved in 2007 because of Dancing with the Stars and the departure of Monday Night Football from ABC (for most of the 2000s, the slot was among the lowest-rated on ABC's prime time schedule, as was the case with the pre-MNF timeslot). Programs normally seen during that hour then aired later on early Wednesday morning after Jimmy Kimmel Live! during the football season. However, in November 2009, this was changed temporarily due to viewer feedback involving the preemption of the series premiere of V, which forced that program to be aired after the Saturday 10 p.m. newscast; for the remainder of November, V aired at 7 p.m., while Tuesday Night Touchback preempted The Insider and aired before prime time in a truncated half-hour format. The station's football coverage eventually was merged into the station's newscasts, along with occasional special coverage which is usually contained to Friday evenings and preempts Shark Tank.[citation needed]\nOn August 7, 2005, WBAY launched their first permanent digital subchannel service, an internally-run full-time weather feed known then as \"Stormcenter 2 24/7\", now \"First Alert Weather 24/7\", featuring a four-pane display of rolling weather conditions, forecasts, traffic reports and advertisements; a seven-day outlook; current radar; and real-time current observations from the regional network of WeatherBug reporting stations. It has never been associated with a national weather network and is run and maintained by the station's meteorologists. It simulcasts the main WBAY channel and goes into a commercial-free format during severe weather events. \nPreviously, WBAY-DT2 had been activated in the summer of 2004, carrying ABC News Now during the Republican and Democratic conventions, along with that year's presidential election. It also broke format in the spring and summer of 2006 to carry gavel-to-gavel coverage of Steven Avery's trial for the murder of Teresa Halbach, and until the move of special coverage to a secondary webfeed, did so for other trials of interest.\nWBAY was one of seven Young-owned stations whose management and operations were handled by Gray Television as part of a proposed takeover of Young Broadcasting by its secured creditors (a plan tentatively approved by a New York bankruptcy judge on July 22, 2009; it was approved in late April 2010[6]). Under Gray management, this made it a semi-sister station in Wisconsin to NBC affiliates WMTV in Madison and WEAU in Eau Claire, and CBS affiliate WSAW-TV in Wausau. The Gray management agreement ended in 2012 as Young returned to some financial stability and the pursuit of a sale partner.\nIn late January 2010, the station stopped signing off during the early morning hours on Saturdays and Sundays, after a major transmitter problem forced the station to reconsider this mode of operation. WBAY was the last commercial station in the state to start broadcasting 24 hours a day daily, the former off-hours on WBAY's main signal are now taken up by a simulcast of WBAY-DT2.\n\nSale to Media General, then Nexstar and resale to Gray Television (2013\u2013present)[edit]\nOn June 6, 2013, Young Broadcasting announced that it would merge with Media General. The sale was approved on November 8, and consummated on November 12.[7] At that time it became both Media General's first station in Wisconsin and the Upper Midwest, and the company's northernmost asset.\nOn March 21, 2014, LIN Media entered into an agreement to merge with Media General in a $1.6 billion deal. Because LIN already owned WLUK-TV and CW affiliate WCWF (channel 14), with WBAY and WLUK ranking among the four highest-rated stations in the Green Bay market in total day viewership, the companies were required to sell either WBAY or WLUK to another station owner in order to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as planned changes to those rules regarding same-market television stations which would prohibit sharing agreements.[8][9][10] On August 20, 2014, Media General announced that it would retain WBAY, trading WLUK and WCWF to Sinclair Broadcast Group as part of several exchanges between other broadcast groups.[11]\nOn January 27, 2016, Media General announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Nexstar Broadcasting Group.[12][13] Because Nexstar already owned WFRV, it was required to sell that station or WBAY to another owner, though with the financial outlay Nexstar had invested into WFRV since its 2011 purchase, a swap for WBAY was unlikely despite the latter's first-place market ranking.\nOn June 3, 2016, it was announced that Nexstar would retain WFRV, selling WBAY to Gray Television for $270 million; this time in addition to the original Gray stations in the 2010 management deal, WBAY also became a sister station to CBS affiliate WSAW-TV and Fox affiliate WZAW-LD in Wausau, and dual NBC/Fox affiliate WLUC-TV in Marquette (which had been an on-and-off sister station to WLUK over the years), which Gray acquired more recently.[14][15] The sale was closed on January 17, 2017, with a possible removal of WBAY on Dish Network due to Gray's previous retransmission consent deal ending averted with a renewal only hours later. The ownership transaction saw WBAY remove the Media General-mandated infotainment program Hollywood Today Live from their schedule (airing in late night on tape delay rather than in the mid-afternoon; the program was cancelled at the end of April) after March 3, along with Gray taking control of the station's website and mobile apps. With WBAY now having sister stations statewide, Gray began to distribute WBAY's Sunday night sports show, Sunday Sports Night: Cover 2, to their other stations with the start of the 2017 NFL season.\nThe station sponsors the yearly \"WBAY Boat Show\" and the \"WBAY RV and Camping Show\", both held in the winter months, formerly at the Brown County Arena/Shopko Hall (which will move to the new expo center in 2021), along with a Boy Scout door-to-door food drive (\"Scouting for Food\") in the fall, and the market's Toys for Tots effort with the Marine Corps Reserve.\n\nProgramming[edit]\nCerebral Palsy Telethon[edit]\nWBAY holds the record for the longest running telethon on the same channel, as it airs the CP Telethon, which has been broadcast on the station since 1954 and benefits Cerebral Palsy, Inc., a local organization involved in the care of cerebral palsy patients and which provides a number of services from their facilities in Green Bay, Suamico, Kimberly, and Two Rivers. The telethon airs for 22 hours from 8 p.m. Saturday to 6 p.m. Sunday during the first weekend in March, although prior to WBAY switching to 24-hour daily broadcasts in 2010, it broke between midnight and 6 a.m., as the station signed off in the overnight hours on weekends (the break allowed WBAY's Saturday syndicated programming to air without interruption). Past hosts of the telethon have included Gloria DeHaven, Raymond Burr, Dennis James (who would later host the United Cerebral Palsy national telethon), Dennis Weaver,[16] and Tom Wopat. Currently, the telethon is a local-only effort, using local broadcasters and people to host the broadcast, and the funds raised benefit the local organization. Before the sale of the WBAY stations by the Norbertine Fathers, the telethon was simulcast over WBAY (AM) (later WGEE, now WTAQ) and WBAY-FM (now WIXX).\nWBAY's cerebral palsy telethon both pre-dated and succeeded the national telethon for United Cerebral Palsy, which ran on numerous stations nationwide from the mid-1970s to 1997.\n\nSunday Mass[edit]\nThe station continues to air a Sunday Mass on Sunday mornings, as it has since signing on under the ownership of the Norbertine Fathers. After the sale of the station, however, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Green Bay began producing the Mass at WBAY's studio. The Diocese provided a presider, choir, liturgical coordinator, and producer while WBAY provided camera operators, a technical director and audio technician.\nOn December 27, 2009, the Diocese of Green Bay ended local production of the Mass, instead choosing to contract with the Passionist Spiritual Center to carry their nationally syndicated Mass program from Riverhead, New York by mutual agreement of the station and the Diocese, a transition that was planned two years before and took priority after the September 2009 death of the Diocese's communications director and Mass producer Tony Kuick.[17]\n\nNews operation[edit]\nThis section needs expansion with: further information on the history of WBAY's news department. You can help by adding to it.  (November 2010)\nWBAY-TV presently broadcasts 36 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours each weekday and three hours each on Saturdays and Sundays), along with a half-hour sports-focused extension of the Sunday late news known as Sunday Sports Night: Cover 2 in football season (as mentioned above, that program airs statewide on Gray's stations as of September 2017). The station currently exchanges news stories with Hearst Television's WISN-TV in Milwaukee, in addition to airing that station's Wisconsin-focused Sunday morning talk show, UpFront with Adrienne Pedersen. Other sharing partners outside of its Gray sisters in Wisconsin are Quincy Newspapers' slate of ABC stations throughout the western part of the state, and Hubbard Broadcasting's ABC stations in Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul and Duluth, Minnesota. The station utilizes the NEXRAD radar from the National Weather Service office just north of Austin Straubel International Airport. It formerly maintained an older self-owned Doppler unit until it mothballed the unit and removed its radar dome atop the station's downtown building in 2015.\n\nWBAY's logo for \"Action 2 News\".\nWBAY's news operation is branded under the Action News title as Action 2 News, and has used the title since the mid-1980s (with the HD suffix added upon its transition to high definition newscasts), predating its ABC affiliation. The station rarely refreshes its graphical imaging, having only done so four times since 1995, but has maintained long-term dominance in the local ratings for most of its history. Until September 2012, when WFRV debuted its 4 p.m. newscast, it was the only one in the market to have a late afternoon newscast in that timeslot. In late 2011, the station released mobile applications for iOS and Android devices, followed by a separate weather app for both platforms in February 2013.\nBecause the station decided to maintain its noon newscast, WBAY-TV was among the few ABC affiliates that carried The Chew on a one-day delay (three days with the Friday edition) at 11 a.m. weekdays due to the network not offering an alternate feed for stations who wish to air the program at an earlier time, which was continued from a one-day delay on All My Children since 1992; this caused complaints among viewers, especially during the holidays when episodes timed to them aired after their occurrence, making the recipes presented in them superfluous. As of September 14, 2015, this was rectified, with The Chew moved to a same-day airing on tape at 2 p.m. and the delay is maintained for the replacement show for The Chew, GMA3: What You Need To Know. The only times of year the station does not run a newscast are on Christmas morning, during the CP telethon, and the evening before Easter when ABC runs The Ten Commandments yearly (due to the film presentation ending after midnight; a one-year shift to an 11 p.m. show was made in 2020 in order to provide up-to-date coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic; two days later, the station also added a special weeknight late night newscast from Gray, Full Court Press Now, to their late night schedule for the next month).\nThe station began the process of upgrading to full HD production with a control room upgrade in the second quarter of 2011, a process hamstrung by the Young bankruptcy until Gray was able to begin operating the company's stations. The news department's conversion began on October 15 after that morning's newscast when construction began on a new set and the relocation of the older set (which had been in use with constant refreshing since the late 1980s) to another part of the building; the new set was completed by mid-December after a training/rehearsal period, using a common set design and graphics package used by all of the New Young stations.[18] On December 14, 2011, WBAY became the second commercial station in the Green Bay market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in HD (after WFRV-TV, which upgraded on June 23, 2011).[19][20] Stormcenter 2 24/7 was switched over on March 12, 2012 to a new presentation format with the current graphics package. After all four local news operations established HD or widescreen presences, WBAY dropped the \"HD\" suffix from their brandings on June 2, 2014. On November 1, 2019, the station unveiled its first new slogan in decades, abandoning \"Coverage You Can Count On\" for the new tagline \"Your First Alert Station\" to tie into the push notifications sent from the station's news and weather mobile apps; likewise, weather is now branded as \"First Alert Weather\". A plan by Gray Television to build a new set to complement the rebranding was delayed to the last part of the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the existing set moved to another part of the building, and the station taking advantage of most of the station's weather team presenting their forecasts from home through the early part of the pandemic during the build-out requiring no use of the weather center, allowing it to be constructed with full secrecy (those meteorologists who did need to be in the building stayed in front of the chyron, and their interactions with the anchors were adjusted to obscure there was a new set being built). The new set was unveiled on September 8, 2020.\nOn September 14, 2020, the station launched two additional newscasts; a 9 a.m. weekday newscast, along with a 4:30\u00a0p.m. newscast to create a 2\u00bd-hour news block in the mid-afternoon, matching WFRV's scheduling in the same time period. The 4:30\u00a0p.m. show is hosted by sports director Chris Roth and has a different format from the station's traditional newscast where Roth checks in with the station's reporters and local subjects in the news for longer-form features regarding those stories, along with an extended weather and astronomy segment with meteorologist Brad Spakowitz entitled \"Three Brilliant Minutes\" (Spakowitz went into semi-retirement in July 2021, but remains with the station for that segment, along with maintaining its weather systems, and as a backup meteorologist).[21]\nFrom 2019 until 2022, the station carried Full Court Press, a national Sunday morning talk show from Gray featuring Appleton native Greta Van Susteren, who regularly provided commentary to WBAY-TV regarding national and local politics as part of her role as the station group's chief national political analyst. The program ended with Van Susteren's departure to Newsmax TV.\n\nNotable former on-air staff[edit]\nRob Fowler \u2013 meteorologist (1985\u20131987; now at WCBD in Charleston, South Carolina)[22]\nJim Hill \u2013 sports contributor (1972\u20131974, now with KCBS-TV and KCAL-TV in Los Angeles)[23]\nOrion Samuelson \u2013 farm director (1950s, hosted programs on WGN radio in Chicago, syndicated television program U.S. Farm Report, and This Week in Agribusiness on RFD-TV)[24]\nBen Tracy \u2013 reporter (now with CBS News)[25]\nMichelle Tuzee (later with KABC-TV in Los Angeles)[26]\nTechnical information[edit]\nSubchannels[edit]\nThe station's signal is multiplexed:\n\n\nSubchannels of WBAY-TV[27]\n\n\nChannel\n\nRes.\n\nAspect\n\nShort name\n\nProgramming\n\n\n2.1\n\n720p\n16:9\nWBAY-HD\nMain WBAY-TV programming / ABC\n\n\n2.2\n\n480i\nWBAY-WX\nFirst Alert Weather 24/7\n\n\n2.3\n\nWBAY365\nThe365[28] / MyNetworkTV\n\n\n2.4\n\nWBAY-HI\nHeroes & Icons\n\n\n2.5\n\nWBAYSTV\nStart TV\n\n\n2.6\n\nWBAYDEC\nCatchy Comedy\n\n\n14.3\n\n480i\n16:9\nCharge!\nCharge!

WBAY-TV was the first commercial station in the market to carry subchannel services, doing so in July 2004 when ABC News Now was launched to cover that year's political conventions.\nIn late June 2010, WBAY-TV became the third commercial station in Green Bay to air syndicated programming (previously only the ABC schedule and ESPN HD broadcasts of Monday Night Football) in high definition. WBAY-TV also began to produce some outside advertising for local businesses and internal station promos in both HD and 16:9 standard definition in mid-2010.\nSince July 2013, the station uses the AFD #10 flag to present all programming in letterboxed widescreen for viewers watching on cable television and over-the-air through traditional 4:3 sets, with the same done for 2.2. and 2.3 within the same year; a re-imaging in November 2015 saw the station's graphical image adjusted to meet this presentation mode. The 2.1 signal had a SAP audio channel added in late September 2013, allowing the station to transmit audio description and Spanish-language dubs of ABC network programming, along with a 2017 upgrade to allow automated description of on-screen weather warning scrolls per new FCC rules.\nAs of 2021, WBAY's secondary weather station transmits natively in 720p after an upgrade, and is available in high definition through the station's website and any simulcasts on WBAY's main channel.\nIn February 2023, the station added programming from MyNetworkTV to the overnight schedule of WBAY-DT3 after the E.\u00a0W. Scripps Company declined to renew its affiliation agreement for WACY-TV in the summer of 2022. The move of MyNetworkTV's all-repeat schedule to overnights on a subchannel has become an increasingly common fate for the service, especially for Gray stations.

It is part of Oklahoma's Regional University System. Beyond its flagship campus in Ada, the university has courses available in McAlester, Shawnee, and Durant, as well as online courses. Founded as East Central State Normal School in 1909, its present name was adopted in 1985.[5] Some of its more prominent alumni include former Microsoft COO B. Kevin Turner, Modernist painter Leon Polk Smith, former NFL player Mark Gastineau, past governors Robert S. Kerr and George Nigh, former U.S. Representative Lyle Boren, Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice Tom Colbert, and U.S. Army General James D. Thurman.\nECU is approximately 90 miles (140\u00a0km) from Oklahoma City, 115 miles (185\u00a0km) from Tulsa and 150 miles (240\u00a0km) from Dallas. Today the campus consists of 37 buildings on 135 acres (55\u00a0ha); the university typically enrolls more than 3,500 students per semester from more than 30 countries and 25 states.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nThe university was founded as East Central State Normal School in 1909, two years after Oklahoma was admitted as the 46th U.S. state. It was one of the six newly created state funded normal schools that were designed to provide four years of \"preparatory\" (or high school) study, followed by two years of college work towards teacher certification. The school's establishment was the product of the intense lobbying efforts of the 25,000 Club, a local booster group.[6] The club raised funds for faculty salaries so classes could begin that fall in local churches and public school classrooms.[6] Graduates of the normal school program received lifetime teaching certification statewide.[5] The 1910 Oklahoma Legislature funded faculty salaries and the construction of a building on a 16-acre (65,000\u00a0m2) site donated by a Chickasaw allottee.[6] In 1919, the normal schools were authorized by the Oklahoma Legislature to offer four years of teacher education, to offer bachelor's degrees, and were designated teachers' colleges.[5]\nFrom 1910 to 1960, East Central operated Horace Mann Training School, a teacher education program designed to equip prospective teachers with classroom skills. From its inception, the training school focused on elementary and junior high students. In 1925, Horace Mann added older students upon achieving a new four-year high school accreditation. In 1953, a new Horace Mann building was completed where the program was housed until Horace Mann Training School was discontinued in 1960.[7]\nExpanding beyond education degrees, in 1939 the school became East Central State College.[6] Fifteen years later, the regional colleges were allowed to offer graduate degrees. By 1974, the state legislature renamed the state colleges, and it became East Central Oklahoma State University\u2014a name it retained until 1985 when it gained its present name.[5]\n\nAcademics[edit]\nECU serves around 4,000 students and is perhaps best known for its Environmental Health Science Program, one of only 30 programs nationally accredited by the National Environmental Health Science and Protection Accreditation Council[8]\n\nA full-size tiger statue in the center of Frank R.

Stonecipher School of Business\nSchool of Graduate Studies\nOther campuses[edit]\nEast Central is no longer one of four participating institutions offering courses at the Ardmore Higher Education Center. There are Distance Education sites located in Shawnee, OK, through the Gordon Cooper Technology Center and McAlester, OK through the Eastern Oklahoma State College.[10] ECU offers online graduate and undergraduate courses.\n\nStudent life[edit]\nEast Central hosts nearly eighty student organizations. Among them are a local chapter of Alpha Psi Omega and Pi Kappa Delta as well as the Student Government Association and Campus Activity Board. In addition, there are five Greek organizations at ECU divided among the Interfraternity Council (IFC) and Panhellenic Association (PHA):\n\nChi Omega Phi Theta Chapter Est.
